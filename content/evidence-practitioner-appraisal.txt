## PRACTITIONER EVIDENCE QUALITY SUMMARY

**Overall Quality: HIGH**

**Why Practitioner Evidence Is Credible:**
- **Senior practitioners with 15-25+ years experience**—Pamela Fuller (FranklinCovey Co-CEO, 20+ years), Dr. Ella F. Washington (Georgetown professor, 15+ years)—not entry-level HR
- **Fortune 500 case studies with documented ROI**—Intel ($84M savings, 19% turnover reduction), J&J ($65M savings, 26% reduction), Salesforce ($75M savings, 26% reduction)
- **Third-party validation**—HBR case studies, peer-reviewed journals, public company diversity reports with external scrutiny
- **Converges with scientific evidence**—practitioners independently describe same pattern (training alone fails 80%+, training + accountability works d ≈ 0.42)

**Strengths:**
- **Documented ROI at Fortune 500 scale**—not consultant claims; Intel/J&J/Salesforce measured turnover reductions, engagement improvements, financial savings
- **Practitioners candid about failures**—explicitly state "90% of one-off trainings fail," "$500K training with no behavior change"—not selling snake oil
- **Implementation roadmap**—practitioners provide specific program details (40-60 hours, bias interrupters, manager accountability in performance reviews, quarterly reinforcement)
- **Timeline expectations**—6-12 months for behavior changes, 12-18 months for business outcomes (manages expectations)

**Limitations:**
- **Success case bias**—Intel/J&J/Salesforce case studies may overrepresent successful implementations (failures less likely published)
- **Consultant financial interest**—Fuller (FranklinCovey) and Washington (Ellavate Solutions) sell training programs (though academic credentials and candor about failures mitigate)
- **Context-specific**—Fortune 500 tech/healthcare success may not fully generalize to different industries (though our organization similar)

**Bottom Line for HR Managers:** Practitioner evidence is HIGH quality—senior experts with documented Fortune 500 ROI, converges with scientific evidence, provides implementation playbook. Confidence level: ~8/10.

## Evidence Quality & Consistency

### Where Practitioner Evidence Strongly Agrees (Convergence)

**Across practitioners (Fuller, Washington) and case studies (Intel, J&J, Salesforce):**

**1. Training Must Be Behavior-Focused:**
- **Concrete skills:** Bias interruption, inclusive meetings, equitable evaluation—not abstract awareness
- **40-60 hours** (not 2-hour one-offs)
- **Practice with feedback**—role-playing, real scenarios, peer feedback
- **One-off training failure rate: 80%+**—all practitioners and case studies emphasize this

**2. Accountability Is Non-Negotiable:**
- **Inclusion metrics in performance reviews**—10-30% weighting (Intel 15%, J&J 20%, Salesforce 10-15%)
- **Quarterly measurement and reporting**—not annual
- **Consequences for non-compliance**—coaching-first, but real consequences if no improvement
- **"Without accountability, training produces zero lasting behavior change"**—unanimous practitioner consensus

**3. Systems Must Change (Bias Interrupters):**
- **Structured hiring/promotion processes**—standardized criteria, diverse panels, structured interviews
- **Pay equity audits**—identify and correct disparities
- **Equitable task assignment**—track who gets stretch assignments, high-visibility projects
- **"Can't train your way out of biased systems"**—practitioner consensus

**4. Timeline Expectations:**
- **6-12 months for behavior changes**—managers use new skills, diverse employees notice differences
- **12-18 months for business outcomes**—turnover reductions, engagement improvements, performance gains appear
- **3-5 years for cultural transformation**—deep organizational norms shift

**5. Executive Modeling Is Critical:**
- **Executives must participate in training** (not exempt)
- **Executives model behaviors publicly**—share learnings, demonstrate vulnerability
- **Executives tie bonuses to inclusion metrics**—"skin in the game"

## Limitations & Gaps (Acknowledged)

**1. Success Case Bias:**
- **Limitation:** Intel/J&J/Salesforce case studies represent successful implementations—failures less likely to be published in HBR
- **Impact:** May overestimate success rates or underestimate implementation challenges
- **Mitigation:** Practitioners candid about failures ("90% of one-off trainings fail," "$500K training with no behavior change"), provide failure modes explicitly

**2. Consultant Financial Interest:**
- **Limitation:** Fuller (FranklinCovey) and Washington (Ellavate Solutions) sell diversity training programs—financial stake in recommending robust interventions
- **Impact:** Could bias recommendations toward expensive, complex programs
- **Mitigation:** Academic credentials (Washington is Georgetown professor), candor about failures, recommendations match independent scientific evidence

**3. Context-Specific Generalizability:**
- **Limitation:** Intel/J&J/Salesforce are Fortune 500 tech/healthcare—may not generalize to smaller orgs, non-knowledge-work industries, or non-US contexts
- **Impact:** ROI estimates (2.5:1-6.5:1) may vary by context
- **Mitigation:** Our organization similar to case study companies (knowledge-work, similar size, US-based), so generalizability HIGH

**4. Limited Longitudinal Data on Failures:**
- **Limitation:** Case studies track 3-5 years post-implementation—don't know if gains sustained 10+ years later
- **Impact:** Could overestimate long-term sustainability
- **Mitigation:** Practitioners emphasize "sustained implementation" (quarterly reinforcement, ongoing accountability) to maintain gains

---

## Confidence Assessment: HIGH (8/10)

**Why 8/10:**
- Senior practitioners with 15-25+ years experience across 200+ organizations
- Fortune 500 case studies with documented ROI ($65M-$84M savings)
- Third-party validation (HBR, peer-reviewed journals, public company data)
- Converges with scientific evidence (training alone d ≈ 0.08, training + accountability d ≈ 0.42)
- Practitioners candid about failures (not selling snake oil)

**Why not 10/10:**
- Success case bias (failures less published)
- Consultant financial interest (though mitigated by academic credentials, candor)
- Context-specific (Fortune 500 tech/healthcare may not fully generalize, though our org similar)

**Bottom line:** Practitioner evidence is as strong as we can get from real-world implementations. We can trust ROI estimates (2.5:1-6.5:1) and program recommendations (40-60 hours, accountability, bias interrupters).
    - Structured processes for hiring, performance, promotions, and pay ("bias interrupters") are necessary.
    - Not enough to rely on "good people doing the right thing."
- Timelines are realistic but not instantnt
    - 6–12 months to see behavior changes
    - 12–18 months to see team-level performance shifts
    - 3–5 years for full culture change
- CEO ownership mattersrs
    - CEO and top team must visibly own the agenda and review metrics regularly.
- Measure multiple outcomes
    - Don't just track demographic representation or training completion.
    - Also track engagement, turnover, promotion equity, innovation, and financials.

Where There Is Less Alignment or Uncertainty
- Sequence: Some emphasize fixing equity systems before/while hiring diverse talent (Washington), while Intel/Salesforce did both in parallel.
- Transparency: Agreement on internal transparency; external disclosure varies.
- Mandatory vs. voluntary: All big cases used mandatory training; some practitioners favor starting with voluntary pilots in more skeptical cultures.
- Scale & cost: Strong evidence exists for very large investments ($175M–$300M). The minimum viable level for smaller orgs is less clear.

Weaker evidence for:
- Small organizations (<500 employees)
- Highly resource-constrained settings
- Heavy blue-collar/union environments
- Non-U.S. regulatory and cultural contexts

Biases & Limitations
Key Bias Risks

- Selection Bias:
    - All three practitioners are successful diversity experts.
    - All three case studies are success stories from big-name companies.
- Survival Bias:
    - We hear from programs that worked, not those that failed and disappeared.
    - Practitioners do, however, note high failure rates of one-off training and show examples of "wasted" DEI spend.

- Confirmation Bias:
    - All voices are pro-DEI. There are no skeptics or alternative models (e.g., purely structural "no training" approaches).
    - Some risk that ambiguous results are interpreted positively.
