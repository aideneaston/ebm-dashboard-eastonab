# Stakeholder Evidence: Methods & Engagement Strategy
# Document your approach to gathering stakeholder perspectives and feedback

## Stakeholder Evidence Goals
**Primary Goal:** Understand the LIVED EXPERIENCE of diverse employees and their managers within the X→M→Y framework. Specifically: (1) How do diverse employees experience the workplace when inclusion mechanisms (M) are weak vs. strong? (2) Which specific manager behaviors help or hurt? (3) What daily barriers do diverse employees face that create the turnover/engagement/promotion gaps we see in organizational data? (4) Do stakeholder perspectives validate the quantitative patterns (27% vs 16% turnover, 12pp engagement gap, 35% slower promotions)?

**Secondary Goal:** Gather stakeholder input on the PROPOSED SOLUTION (40-60 hour inclusive leadership training + accountability structures) to ensure it addresses real needs, not just statistical artifacts. Specifically: (1) What do diverse employees want from their managers? (2) What training content would help managers most? (3) What concerns do managers have about the initiative? (4) What implementation approach would maximize buy-in and minimize backlash? (5) How should we measure success from stakeholder perspectives?

## Target Stakeholder Groups

### Internal Stakeholders
#### Management/Leadership
- **Target Participants:** 
  - **Mid-level managers** (n=50): Direct supervisors of diverse employees, target population for training
  - **Senior leadership** (n=10): C-suite and VPs who will sponsor initiative and sustain commitment
  - **High-performing inclusive managers** (n=15): Managers with low turnover, high engagement in diverse teams (identified from organizational data - units with 80%+ training adoption and strong outcomes)
  
- **Engagement Method:** 
  - **Mid-level managers**: Online survey (quantitative baseline) + 15 semi-structured interviews (qualitative depth)
  - **Senior leadership**: 1-on-1 interviews (60 min each, confidential) to assess commitment, concerns, expectations
  - **High-performers**: In-depth interviews (90 min) + observation of team meetings to identify effective behaviors
  
- **Key Questions Focus:** 
  - What challenges do you face managing diverse teams? What works? What doesn't?
  - What training/support do you need to be more effective?
  - What concerns do you have about 40-60 hour training program + accountability metrics?
  - How do you currently handle bias, conflict, or exclusion on your team?
  - What would success look like from your perspective?
  - What barriers exist to creating inclusive team climates?
  
- **Expected Response Rate:** 
  - Survey: 65-70% (n=33-35 of 50 managers)
  - Interviews (mid-level): 30% (n=15 of 50 invited) - purposive sampling of high/medium/low performers
  - Senior leadership: 100% (n=10) - critical stakeholders, mandatory participation secured via CEO
  - High-performers: 100% (n=15) - identified as exemplars, likely willing to share

#### Employees/Staff
- **Target Participants:** 
  - **Diverse employees** (n=150): Stratified random sample of employees identifying as racial/ethnic minorities, women in male-dominated roles, LGBTQ+, disabilities, first-generation professionals
    - 60 from high-turnover units (bottom quartile: >22% diverse turnover)
    - 60 from low-turnover units (top quartile: <18% diverse turnover)
    - 30 from mid-range units (comparison group)
  - **Majority employees** (n=50): For comparison - do they perceive different workplace experiences?
  - **Recently departed employees** (n=30): Diverse employees who left in past 12 months (exit interview data + follow-up outreach)
  
- **Engagement Method:** 
  - **Current employees**: Online anonymous survey (quantitative + open-ended) + 6 focus groups (8-10 participants each, stratified by demographics and turnover context)
  - **Departed employees**: Phone interviews (30 min, offered $50 gift card incentive) to understand why they left
  - **Focus groups**: Homogeneous composition (e.g., women of color only, Hispanic/Latino only) to enable psychological safety for sharing sensitive experiences
  
- **Key Questions Focus:** 
  - Describe your daily experience as a [demographic] employee. What makes you feel included or excluded?
  - Which specific manager behaviors make you feel valued? Which make you feel marginalized?
  - Have you considered leaving? Why or why not? (Current employees)
  - Why did you ultimately decide to leave? (Departed employees)
  - Do you see equitable opportunities for high-visibility projects, promotions, development?
  - What would make this a better workplace for you?
  - What should managers be trained to do differently?
  - How should the organization hold managers accountable for inclusion?
  
- **Expected Response Rate:** 
  - Survey: 55-60% (n=110-120 of 200 invited) - lower than manager survey due to trust concerns, anonymity critical
  - Focus groups: 40% (n=48-60 participants across 6 groups) - smaller groups, voluntary, incentivized with food/gift cards
  - Departed employees: 25-30% (n=8-10 of 30 contacted) - lower rate due to time lag, reluctance to engage with former employer

#### Other Internal Groups
- **HR Business Partners** (n=8): HRBP's embedded in business units see patterns across managers/teams
  - Method: Focus group (90 min) + individual interviews (45 min each)
  - Questions: What diversity/inclusion issues do you see repeatedly? Which managers struggle? What interventions have you tried? What works?
  
- **Employee Resource Group (ERG) Leaders** (n=12): Leaders of Women's Network, Black Employee Network, LGBTQ+ Alliance, Hispanic/Latino Association, Asian Professional Network, Veterans Network
  - Method: Joint meeting (2 hours) + individual follow-up interviews (30 min each)
  - Questions: What are the top 3 issues your ERG members raise? What solutions have you advocated for? What manager behaviors do members report as helpful/harmful? How can training address ERG member concerns?
  
- **Union Representatives** (n=4): If any workforce is unionized, union reps have insights on member concerns
  - Method: 1-on-1 interviews (60 min each)
  - Questions: What have union members raised about diversity/inclusion? How does this intersect with labor relations? What concerns would union have about this initiative?
  
- **Talent Acquisition Team** (n=6): Recruiters see why diverse candidates accept or decline offers
  - Method: Focus group (90 min)
  - Questions: What do diverse candidates say about our organization during interviews? What concerns do they raise? What makes them choose us or competitors? How does our reputation on inclusion affect recruiting?

### External Stakeholders
#### Customers/Clients
- **Target Participants:** NOT PRIMARY FOCUS for this initiative (internal culture change), but will gather limited input:
  - **B2B clients** (n=10): Key accounts that value supplier diversity and inclusion
  - **Customer advisory board** (n=12): If one exists, standing group for feedback
  
- **Engagement Method:** 
  - Brief inclusion in existing customer satisfaction surveys (2-3 questions added)
  - Opportunistic conversations during quarterly business reviews
  
- **Key Questions Focus:** 
  - Does our team's diversity and inclusion practices affect your perception of our organization?
  - Have you noticed any issues with how our teams collaborate internally that impact service delivery?
  - Does our commitment to diversity/inclusion factor into your purchasing decisions?
  
- **Expected Response Rate:** 
  - Survey addition: 30-40% (n=3-4 of 10 targeted clients) - low priority, optional questions
  - NOT CRITICAL to decision - organizational + employee evidence is sufficient for internal culture initiative

#### Partners/Suppliers
- **Target Participants:** NOT INCLUDED in this phase
  - Partners/suppliers have limited visibility into internal culture
  - Their input more relevant for external reputation/brand work, not internal training intervention
  
- **Engagement Method:** N/A for this initiative
  
- **Key Questions Focus:** N/A
  
- **Expected Response Rate:** N/A

**RATIONALE FOR LIMITED EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT:**
This is an INTERNAL culture change initiative focused on manager behavior and employee experience. External stakeholders (customers, partners, suppliers) have limited insight into daily manager-employee interactions, psychological safety, bias in assignments/promotions, etc. 

Scientific evidence (Studies 3, 6, 12) and organizational data (turnover, engagement, promotion gaps) already establish the problem. External validation not needed. Resources better spent on deep engagement with employees and managers who directly experience and create the problem.

Exception: If organization has CLIENT-FACING diversity initiatives (e.g., supplier diversity requirements, ESG reporting commitments), may need external stakeholder input to understand reputational risks. But for THIS decision (implement inclusive leadership training), internal stakeholders are sufficient and most relevant.

## Data Collection Methods

### Survey Design
#### Online Survey Platform
- **Platform Choice:** Qualtrics (enterprise license, HIPAA-compliant, strong anonymity protections, advanced skip logic, mobile-optimized)
  - Backup: SurveyMonkey if Qualtrics unavailable
  - NOT Google Forms (limited anonymity, data sovereignty concerns for employee data)
  
- **Survey Length:** 
  - **Manager survey**: 15-20 minutes (30-35 questions)
  - **Employee survey**: 12-15 minutes (25-30 questions)
  - Pilot tested with 5 employees and 5 managers to ensure clarity and reasonable time burden
  
- **Question Types:** 
  - 60% rating scales (7-point Likert: Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree) - enables quantitative analysis
  - 25% multiple choice (pre-coded responses based on pilot feedback)
  - 15% open-ended (2-3 questions at end: "Anything else you'd like to share?") - captures unexpected themes
  - Validated scales where possible (e.g., Nishii Inclusion Climate Scale, Edmondson Psychological Safety Scale)
  
- **Incentives:** 
  - **Employees**: $10 Amazon gift card for completed survey (anonymous code system - survey completion generates code, employee submits separately to HR for gift card)
  - **Managers**: No financial incentive (professional expectation), but framed as "your input shapes the training you'll receive"
  - **All**: Entry into raffle for 5x $100 gift cards (optional, separate from anonymous survey)
  - **Recognition**: Aggregate results shared back with all participants - "you contributed to this report"

#### Interview Questions

**SENIOR LEADERSHIP INTERVIEWS** (60 minutes)

**Opening Questions:**
- Tell me about your perspective on diversity and inclusion at our organization. What's working? What's not?
- How long have you been aware that diverse employees have higher turnover, lower engagement, and slower promotions? What has driven your awareness?

**Problem Exploration:**
- From your vantage point, what causes the performance gaps we see between diverse and majority employees? (Probe X→M→Y: Is it diversity itself, or lack of inclusion mechanisms?)
- What have we tried in the past to address diversity/inclusion? What worked? What didn't? Why?
- What's the business case for addressing this? How important is this relative to other strategic priorities?
- What would happen if we don't address this problem? What are the risks?

**Solution Discussion:**
- We're proposing 40-60 hours of inclusive leadership training + accountability structures (metrics in performance reviews). What's your reaction?
- What concerns do you have about this approach? What might go wrong?
- What would make you confident this initiative will succeed vs. be another "diversity program" that doesn't stick?
- How much are you willing to invest? (Probe: $3M over 2 years for 200 managers, 18-24 month timeline)

**Implementation and Commitment Questions:**
- What level of personal involvement do you want to have? (Sponsor? Champion? Hands-off once funded?)
- How will you communicate the importance of this to the organization? What message will you send?
- What if results at 12 months are mixed? Will you stay committed through 24-month timeline?
- What would you do if managers resist or push back on the training/accountability?
- How should we measure success from your perspective? What outcomes matter most?
- Who else in senior leadership needs to be aligned? How do we ensure sustained commitment if you leave or change roles?

**MANAGER INTERVIEWS** (45 minutes)

**Opening Questions:**
- Tell me about your experience managing a diverse team. What's been rewarding? What's been challenging?

- Have you noticed different experiences or outcomes for diverse vs. majority employees on your team? (Probe: Engagement, turnover, promotions, assignments)
- What makes it difficult to create an inclusive team environment? What barriers do you face?
- Do you feel equipped to handle bias, exclusion, or conflict related to diversity? What would help you be more effective?

**Solution Discussion - Introducing X→M→Y Framework:**
- Our data shows diverse employees have 27% turnover vs. 16% for majority employees. But in units where managers have completed inclusion training AND have accountability, turnover is equal. Does this match your experience?

**DEPARTED EMPLOYEE INTERVIEWS** (30 minutes - exit interview follow-up)

**Opening:**
- Thank you for taking time to talk even though you've moved on. We're trying to understand why diverse employees leave at higher rates and what we can do better. Your honest feedback would be incredibly valuable and won't affect any references or relationship with the company.

**Understanding Their Decision:**
- Why did you ultimately decide to leave our organization? (Let them talk, minimal interruption)
- Was diversity/inclusion a factor in your decision? (If yes: Tell me more. If no: What were the main factors?)
- Tell me about your relationship with your manager. How did that affect your decision?
- Did you feel you had equal opportunities compared to your peers? (Projects, promotions, development, visibility)

**What We Could Have Done Differently:**
- Was there a moment or event where you thought "I can't stay here anymore"? What happened?
- If your manager had done X differently, would you have stayed? What would have had to change?
- Did you raise concerns about inclusion before leaving? (If yes: What happened when you raised them?)

**Advice for Change:**
- If we could go back in time, what should we have done differently to retain you?
- We're planning inclusive leadership training for managers. Would that have made a difference for you?
- What advice would you give to diverse employees who are still at the organization?

**Learning from Their New Employer:**
- How is your new employer different regarding diversity and inclusion? What are they doing that we weren't?
- What can we learn from your experience?

### Focus Groups (if applicable)
#### Focus Group Design
- **Group Size:** 8-10 participants per group (optimal for everyone to speak, per research on focus group dynamics)
  
- **Number of Groups:** 6 focus groups total
  - **Group 1**: Women of color only (n=8-10) - intersectional experience often unique
  - **Group 2**: Women in male-dominated technical roles (n=8-10) - gender dynamics
  - **Group 3**: Employees of color (mixed gender) from high-turnover units (n=8-10) - worst-case experiences
  - **Group 4**: Employees of color from low-turnover units (n=8-10) - success stories, what works
  - **Group 5**: LGBTQ+ employees (all races/genders) (n=8-10) - specific inclusion challenges
  - **Group 6**: HR Business Partners (n=8) - organizational perspective
  
- **Group Composition:** HOMOGENEOUS by identity group (Groups 1-5) - Rationale: Psychological safety to discuss sensitive experiences requires shared identity. Mixed groups risk majority voices dominating or diverse employees self-censoring. Research shows homogeneous focus groups yield richer data on marginalization experiences.
  
- **Facilitation:** 
  - **Facilitator identity matching preferred**: Women of color facilitate Group 1, LGBTQ+ facilitator for Group 5, etc. Builds trust, reduces power dynamics
  - **External facilitator** (not internal staff) - increases candor, confidentiality perception
  - **Co-facilitator model**: Lead facilitator guides discussion, co-facilitator takes notes, monitors body language, ensures all speak
  - **Training**: Facilitators trained on trauma-informed practices, managing group dynamics, probing sensitively
  - **Protocol**: Semi-structured guide with flexibility to follow emergent themes
  - **Duration**: 90 minutes (allows depth without exhausting participants)
  - **Setting**: Private conference room, circle seating (not classroom), food provided, relaxed atmosphere
  - **Ground rules**: Confidentiality, one person speaks at a time, respect all perspectives, right to pass on any question

1. **Opening (10 min)**: Introductions (first name only, role/dept, how long at org), ground rules, icebreaker ("What brought you to this organization?")

2. **Inclusion Experience (20 min)**: 
   - "Think about a time you felt fully included at work. What was happening? What made it feel that way?"

6. **Closing (5 min)**:
   - "If you could tell senior leadership one thing about your experience, what would it be?"
   - "Anything we didn't ask that we should have?"
   - Thank you, explain next steps, provide contact for follow-up questions

## Sampling Strategy

### Stakeholder Identification
#### Stakeholder Mapping
**Primary Stakeholders** (directly affected by problem and solution):
1. **Diverse employees** (n=200): Experience the problem daily, beneficiaries of solution
2. **Mid-level managers** (n=50): Create the problem (when M is weak) or solution (when M is strong), target of training
3. **Senior leadership** (n=10): Fund and sustain initiative, set accountability expectations

**Secondary Stakeholders** (insight providers, implementation enablers):
4. **HR Business Partners** (n=8): See patterns, implement systems
5. **ERG Leaders** (n=12): Represent diverse employee voices
6. **High-performing managers** (n=15): Model effective M behaviors
7. **Departed employees** (n=30): Exit perspective on why diversity turnover is high

**Total Stakeholders**: ~325 individuals across 7 groups

#### Sampling Approach
- **Total Target Sample:** 325 stakeholders engaged via surveys, interviews, focus groups
  - Survey responses expected: ~150 (managers n=35, employees n=115)
  - Interview participants: ~75 (leadership n=10, managers n=15, high-performers n=15, employees n=10, departed n=8, HR/ERG n=17)
  - Focus group participants: ~50 (6 groups × 8-10 people)
  - **TOTAL ENGAGED: ~200 unique individuals** (some participate in multiple methods)
  
- **Sampling Method by Group:**
  - **Senior leadership**: CENSUS (all 10 C-suite/VPs) - too small for sampling, need all perspectives
  - **Mid-level managers**: STRATIFIED RANDOM sample (n=50 of ~200 total managers)
    - Stratify by: Performance level (high/medium/low based on turnover/engagement data), industry/function, years of experience
    - Ensures representation across contexts
  - **Diverse employees**: STRATIFIED PURPOSIVE sample (n=200 of ~1,500 diverse employees)
    - Stratify by: Demographics (race, gender, age), job level, unit turnover (high/medium/low), tenure
    - Purposive: Oversample high-turnover units (where problem is worst) for deeper understanding
  - **High-performing managers**: PURPOSIVE sample (n=15) - identified from organizational data as exemplars (low turnover, high engagement in diverse teams)
  - **Departed employees**: CONVENIENCE sample (n=30 contacted, expect n=8-10 responses) - whoever responds to outreach
  - **HR/ERG leaders**: CENSUS (all HRBPs n=8, all ERG leaders n=12) - key informants
  
- **Representation Goals:**
  - **Demographic diversity**: Ensure all major identity groups represented (racial/ethnic minorities, women, LGBTQ+, disabilities, ages, generations)
  - **Experience diversity**: New employees (<2 years) and veterans (10+ years)
  - **Performance diversity**: High, medium, low performers (avoid survivorship bias - include people struggling)
  - **Context diversity**: All major business units, functions, geographies
  - **Perspective diversity**: Supporters and skeptics of diversity initiatives (avoid echo chamber - deliberately seek out resistant managers)

- **Legal**: Review consent language, ensure compliance with employee privacy laws

## Ethical Considerations

### Informed Consent
- **Purpose Explanation:** "We're gathering input to design an inclusive leadership training program for managers. We want to understand your experience with diversity and inclusion at work and what would make this a better workplace. Your honest feedback will directly shape the initiative."
  
- **Participation Voluntariness:** 
  - "Participation is completely voluntary. You can skip any question. You can exit the survey anytime. Declining won't affect your employment, performance review, or relationship with the organization."
  - For interviews: "You can end the interview at any time. You can decline to answer any question."
  - **NO PENALTY for non-participation** - emphasized prominently
  
- **Data Use:** 
  - "Your responses will be combined with others to identify themes and patterns. Results will be shared with senior leadership and the training design team in AGGREGATE form only (groups of 10+ people)."
  - "Quotes may be used in reports but will be de-identified (no names, roles edited to protect identity)"
  - "Data will inform: (1) training curriculum design, (2) accountability structure design, (3) implementation approach, (4) success metrics"
  
- **Anonymity/Confidentiality:** 
  - **Surveys**: "Completely anonymous - no names, emails, or IP addresses collected. Qualtrics anonymity settings enabled. Individual responses cannot be identified."
  - **Interviews**: "Confidential but not anonymous (I know who you are). Recordings will be transcribed and de-identified (your name replaced with ID code, identifying details removed). Transcripts stored on secure server. Only research team has access. Your manager/HR will NOT see your individual responses."
  - **Focus groups**: "Confidential to group - what's said here stays here. We ask all participants to maintain confidentiality. However, we cannot guarantee other participants will maintain confidentiality, so please don't share information you're not comfortable with others knowing."
  - **Demographic data**: "Optional. Will only be reported in aggregate (10+ people per group). If your demographic combination is unique, we won't report it."

### Organizational Permissions
- **Supervisor Approval:** 
  - **YES** - Formal approvals required before engaging employees:
    - CEO approval for organization-wide initiative
    - CHRO approval for HR-related content and employee engagement
    - Business unit leaders approval for engaging their employees (courtesy, not veto power)
    - Union leadership approval if engaging unionized employees
  
- **HR Consultation:** 
  - **ESSENTIAL** - HR is partner, not gatekeeper:
    - **Survey review**: HR reviews questions for legal compliance (no questions that create liability exposure)
    - **Recruitment coordination**: HR helps identify sampling frame (employee lists by demographics, performance data)
    - **Communication strategy**: HR advises on timing (avoid survey fatigue), messaging, channels
    - **Data security**: HR ensures compliance with employee data privacy policies
    - **Risk management**: HR flags potential issues (e.g., asking about discrimination incidents requires reporting protocols)
    - **Union coordination**: HR facilitates union consultation if applicable
  
- **External Stakeholder Protocols:** 
  - **Departed employees**: No special permission needed (they're no longer employees), but:
    - Legal review of outreach to ensure no "solicitation" concerns
    - Gift card offered (not excessive - $50 is reasonable, $500 would be coercive)
    - Clear that participation is optional, no relationship implications
  - **Customers** (limited engagement): Not engaging for this initiative, but if we were:
    - Client relationship manager approval before contacting
    - Gift card NOT offered (could be viewed as improper business gift)
    - Questions vetted to avoid competitive intelligence concerns

**ETHICAL RED FLAGS TO AVOID:**
❌ Asking employees to reveal information that could identify them to management
❌ Asking questions about illegal discrimination without having reporting/resolution process
❌ Creating expectation that feedback will lead to individual action against specific manager
❌ Coercing participation (mandatory surveys, participation affects performance review)
❌ Insufficient anonymity protections (collecting more identifying data than necessary)
❌ Sharing individual responses with managers/HR
❌ Using data for purposes beyond stated intent (e.g., identifying "problem" employees)
❌ Failing to act on feedback (engagement without action erodes trust)

## Response Rate Strategy

### Maximizing Participation
#### Engagement Tactics
- **Leadership Endorsement:** 
  - **CEO email** on Day 1: "This is a priority. Your voice matters. Please participate." (Sent from CEO's actual email, not communications team)
  - **Business unit leaders**: Mention in team meetings ("Please complete the survey this week")
  - **Senior leadership visibility**: Leaders publicly state they completed survey (model behavior)
  - **ERG leader endorsement**: "We've reviewed the questions. This is legitimate. Your confidentiality is protected."
  
- **Clear Value Proposition:** 
  - **For managers**: "Design the training YOU need. Your input = relevant, practical content vs. generic diversity training"
  - **For employees**: "Shape your workplace. This isn't just data collection - leadership will act on findings"
  - **Transparency**: "Here's exactly how we'll use your input: (1) curriculum design, (2) accountability systems, (3) implementation approach"
  - **Results sharing**: "All participants will receive summary report of findings - see how your voice contributed"
  
- **Convenient Participation:** 
  - **Time estimate**: Accurate ("12-15 min" not "quick survey" - respect their time)
  - **Mobile-optimized**: Complete on phone during commute, lunch break
  - **Save-and-return**: Can exit and come back later (Qualtrics feature)
  - **Multiple access points**: Email link, intranet, QR codes
  - **Flexible timing**: 2-week window allows scheduling around priorities
  - **Work time OK**: Explicitly state "You may complete during work hours - this is work, not personal time"
  
- **Multiple Touchpoints:** 
  - **Email**: 4 touchpoints (invitation + 3 reminders)
  - **Intranet**: Announcement on homepage
  - **Meetings**: Leaders mention in team meetings
  - **ERGs**: Posted in ERG channels/newsletters
  - **Posters**: Breakrooms (for non-desk employees)
  - **Peer influence**: Show participation rate ("68% of your peers have responded") to create social norm

#### Incentive Strategy
- **Direct Incentives:** 
  - **Employees**: $10 Amazon gift card for survey (anonymous code system - Qualtrics generates code at completion, employee submits code separately for gift card)
  - **Focus groups**: $25 gift card + food (lunch or snacks depending on timing)
  - **Departed employees**: $50 gift card for 30-min interview (compensation for inconvenience)
  - **Managers**: NO financial incentive (professional expectation), but raffle entry for 5× $100 cards (optional)
  - **Total incentive budget**: ~$2,500 ($10×150 employees + $25×50 focus groups + $50×10 departed + $500 raffle)
  
- **Indirect Benefits:** 
  - **Employees**: Better managers (if training works), more inclusive workplace, reduced frustration
  - **Managers**: Training tailored to their needs, clearer expectations, tools to handle difficult situations
  - **Organization**: Lower turnover costs, higher engagement, better performance (benefits everyone)
  - **Voice**: Psychological benefit of being heard, contributing to organizational improvement
  
- **Recognition:** 
  - **Aggregate acknowledgment**: "Thank you to the 183 employees and managers who participated"
  - **No individual recognition** (protects anonymity)
  - **Impact stories**: "Your feedback led to these changes..." (show their input mattered)
  - **Follow-up communication**: "Here's what we learned from you..." (close the loop)

### Minimum Viable Sample
- **Minimum Response Rate:** 
  - **Managers**: 50% (n=25 of 50) - Need reasonable representation to claim manager buy-in, 25 is sufficient for quantitative analysis
  - **Employees**: 40% (n=80 of 200) - Diverse perspectives critical, 80 gives good statistical power and qualitative richness
  - **Senior leadership**: 80% (n=8 of 10) - Small group, need most perspectives
  - **Interviews**: 50% of targets (n=38 of 75 invited) - Qualitative saturation typically occurs by 25-30 interviews
  - **Focus groups**: 5 of 6 groups with 8+ participants - One group cancellation acceptable
  
- **Backup Plan if Response Rates Low:** 
  
  **If manager survey <50% by Day 10:**
  - Escalate to CHRO: Send personal email from CHRO emphasizing importance
  - Extend deadline 3 days (to Day 17)
  - Offer raffle incentive increase (10× $50 cards vs. 5× $100)
  - Target non-responders: "We're missing perspectives from [function/level] - please participate"
  - If still <40%: Accept lower rate but acknowledge limitation in reporting ("Manager sample is small, may not represent all perspectives")
  
  **If employee survey <40% by Day 10:**
  - ERG leader push: Ask ERG leaders to personally encourage members
  - Incentive increase: $15 gift card vs. $10
  - Simplified survey: Remove optional demographics, reduce to 10 min
  - Extend deadline 5 days (to Day 19)
  - Alternative recruiting: In-person recruitment at high-traffic areas (cafeteria, lobby) with tablets for on-site completion
  - If still <30%: Supplement with additional focus groups (3 more groups, purposively recruited)
  
  **If focus group recruitment low:**
  - Increase incentive ($50 vs. $25)
  - Offer virtual option (lower barrier than in-person)
  - Shorten duration (60 min vs. 90 min)
  - Personal recruitment: HR BPs and ERG leaders directly invite specific individuals
  - Alternative: Convert to small group interviews (3-4 people, 45 min) - less rich but better than nothing
  
- **Alternative Methods if Primary Methods Fail:** 
  1. **Mine existing data**: Exit interview data, engagement survey comments, Glassdoor reviews, ERG meeting notes
  2. **Observation**: Shadow managers for 2-4 hours each (n=10), observe team meetings, note inclusive/exclusive behaviors
  3. **Document analysis**: Review promotion data, assignment patterns, performance review text (with anonymization)
  4. **Pulse surveys**: Very short (5 questions, 3 min) sent multiple times vs. one longer survey
  5. **Anonymous submission boxes**: Low-tech but accessible - physical boxes in breakrooms for written feedback
  6. **Leverage practitioners**: Rely more heavily on practitioner evidence (experts, case studies) if stakeholder engagement fails
  7. **Pilot-as-research**: Launch small pilot, gather feedback during implementation vs. before

**RISK MITIGATION**: Start outreach early (Week 2 of 8-week plan), monitor daily response rates, trigger backup plans quickly if needed. Low response rate undermines stakeholder evidence credibility - better to invest extra effort upfront than have weak data.

## Data Management Plan

### Data Collection Organization

- **Response Tracking:** 
  
  **Survey Tracking (Qualtrics Dashboard):**
  - **Real-time monitoring**: Daily checks of response rate by stakeholder group (managers, employees, HR, ERG leaders)
  - **Demographic tracking**: Monitor responses by gender, race/ethnicity, tenure, department to ensure representative sample (uses Qualtrics quota/panel features)
  - **Completion tracking**: Track partial completions (started but didn't finish) to identify survey length issues
  - **Non-respondent list**: Qualtrics generates list of non-responders (email addresses collected separately from responses to maintain anonymity) for targeted follow-up
  - **Reminder automation**: Qualtrics sends automated reminders to non-responders on Days 5, 10, 12
  
  **Interview/Focus Group Tracking (Excel + Calendly):**
  - **Master scheduling spreadsheet**: Tracks invited participants, confirmed participants, completed sessions, no-shows
  - **Confirmation system**: Calendly sends auto-confirmations + manual confirmation email 24 hours prior
  - **Completion log**: After each session, mark as "completed" with date, duration, participant code, recording file name
  - **Follow-up tracking**: Track thank-you emails sent, transcripts returned for member checking
  
  **Participation Dashboard:**
  - **Weekly summary**: Report to CHRO on response rates, completion rates, demographic representation
  - **Red flags**: Alert if any subgroup <30% response (e.g., "Only 22% of Black employees responded - need targeted outreach")
  - **Progress visualization**: Charts showing daily cumulative responses to identify momentum or stalling

- **Data Storage:** 
  
  **Survey Data (Qualtrics):**
  - **Primary storage**: Qualtrics secure servers (HIPAA-compliant, SOC 2 Type II certified)
  - **Access control**: Only 2 people have admin access (researcher conducting study + CHRO as backup)
  - **Anonymized export**: Export data with IP addresses and timestamps REMOVED before analysis
  - **Retention**: Data deleted from Qualtrics servers 3 years after project completion (per data retention policy)
  
  **Interview/Focus Group Data:**
  - **Recordings**: Stored on encrypted external hard drive (password-protected, 256-bit encryption) in locked office
  - **Transcripts**: De-identified transcripts stored on secure SharePoint with restricted access (only researcher + 1 analyst)
  - **Physical notes**: Locked filing cabinet in researcher's office (only researcher has key)
  - **Email communications**: Recruitment/scheduling emails stored in separate folder from response data
  
  **Analysis Files:**
  - **Working datasets**: Secure SharePoint folder with version control (v1, v2, etc.)
  - **Coding files**: NVivo project files backed up weekly to SharePoint
  - **Integrated datasets**: Final merged data (surveys + interviews + focus groups) stored on SharePoint with access limited to 3 people

- **Data Security:** 
  
  **Anonymization Protocols:**
  - **Survey anonymity**: Qualtrics does NOT record names/emails with responses. Separate panel tracks who responded (for reminders) but panel data NEVER merged with response data.
  - **De-identification**: Interview transcripts replace all identifying info: real names → "Manager 1", departments → "Business Unit A", specific projects → generic descriptions
  - **Geographic removal**: Remove city names, building numbers, specific locations
  - **Extreme case protection**: If someone shares unique story (e.g., "I was the only Black woman promoted last year"), either exclude detail or ask permission to include
  
  **Access Controls:**
  - **Role-based access**: Only people who need data for analysis have access (researcher, analyst, CHRO oversight only)
  - **No sharing**: Raw data never shared with business unit leaders, managers, or other stakeholders - only aggregate reports
  - **Password protection**: All files password-protected (minimum 12 characters, complexity requirements)
  - **Two-factor authentication**: SharePoint requires 2FA for access
  
  **Confidentiality Protections:**
  - **Reporting rules**: No individual quotes attributed by name, department, or demographic if identifiable
  - **Aggregate reporting**: "67% of managers reported..." not "John said..."
  - **Minimum cell sizes**: Never report subgroups <5 people (e.g., don't say "3 of 4 Asian managers said..." - too identifiable)
  - **Separated storage**: Contact info (for gift cards, follow-up) stored completely separately from response data
  
  **Legal Compliance:**
  - **IRB equivalent**: Though not academic research, treat as if IRB-approved (ethical standards)
  - **Employment law**: Consult legal team to ensure no EEOC violations (collecting demographic data appropriately)
  - **Union notification**: If applicable, notify union of data collection per CBA

### Analysis Preparation

- **Coding Strategy (Qualitative Data):** 
  
  **Interview/Focus Group Transcripts:**
  
  **Phase 1 - Deductive Coding (Theory-Driven):**
  - **X variables (Diversity)**: Code mentions of diverse employee experiences, majority employee experiences, demographic patterns
  - **M variables (Inclusion Mechanisms)**: Code manager behaviors (inviting input, interrupting, bias, psychological safety), training references, accountability mentions, organizational systems
  - **Y variables (Performance)**: Code turnover intentions, engagement, productivity, innovation, promotion experiences
  - **Causal links**: Code statements connecting X→M, M→Y, X→M→Y
  - Example: "My manager never asks my opinion in meetings [M], so I've checked out [Y]" = M→Y link
  
  **Phase 2 - Inductive Coding (Emergent Themes):**
  - **Open coding**: Identify themes NOT predicted by X→M→Y model (e.g., work-life balance issues, compensation concerns)
  - **In-vivo codes**: Use participants' own language (e.g., if multiple people say "walking on eggshells," code as that)
  - **Pattern identification**: Look for repeated themes across interviews (e.g., if 8 of 10 diverse employees mention microaggressions, that's a pattern)
  
  **Phase 3 - Axial Coding:**
  - **Relationships**: How do themes relate? (e.g., microaggressions → reduced psychological safety → lower engagement)
  - **Conditions**: When do patterns occur? (e.g., bias worse in male-dominated departments)
  - **Consequences**: What are impacts? (e.g., exclusion leads to turnover intentions)
  
  **Software**: NVivo for qualitative coding (allows coding transcripts, organizing codes into themes, running queries)
  
  **Reliability**: Second coder codes 20% of transcripts independently, calculate inter-rater reliability (kappa >0.70 target)

- **Quantitative Analysis (Survey Data):** 
  
  **Descriptive Statistics:**
  - **Frequencies**: % of managers/employees reporting each experience (e.g., "54% of diverse employees reported exclusion from key projects at least monthly")
  - **Means and SDs**: Average inclusion climate score (Nishii scale), psychological safety score (Edmondson scale)
  - **Subgroup comparisons**: Compare diverse vs. majority employees, high-turnover vs. low-turnover units, different demographic groups
  
  **Inferential Statistics:**
  - **t-tests**: Do diverse employees report lower inclusion climate than majority employees? (test difference in means)
  - **ANOVA**: Do inclusion climate scores differ across departments? (test differences across 3+ groups)
  - **Chi-square**: Is exclusion experience associated with turnover intentions? (test relationship between categorical variables)
  - **Correlation**: Relationship between training receptiveness and current inclusion climate (r coefficient)
  
  **Regression Analysis (if sufficient sample size, n>100):**
  - **Test X→M→Y pathways**: Does diversity (X) predict lower performance (Y) when inclusion mechanisms (M) are weak?
  - **Mediation**: Does manager training/accountability (M) mediate relationship between diversity (X) and performance (Y)?
  - Model: Performance = b0 + b1(Diversity) + b2(Inclusion Mechanisms) + b3(Diversity × Inclusion) + error
  - Hypothesis: b3 interaction term significant = diversity + inclusion together improve performance
  
  **Software**: SPSS or R for statistical analysis
  
  **Significance level**: α = 0.05 (p<0.05 considered statistically significant)
  
  **Practical significance**: Even if statistically significant, assess effect size (Cohen's d >0.3 for practical importance)

- **Integration Plan (Combining Data Sources):** 
  
  **Triangulation Strategy:**
  
  1. **Convergence Check**: Do surveys, interviews, focus groups tell same story?
     - Example: Survey shows 67% of diverse employees report exclusion → Interviews provide specific examples of exclusion → Focus groups identify patterns of exclusion → **CONVERGENT**
     - If divergent, investigate why (e.g., social desirability in surveys vs. candor in anonymous interviews)
  
  2. **Complementarity**: Different methods answer different questions
     - Surveys: How prevalent? (breadth)
     - Interviews: What does it feel like? (depth)
     - Focus groups: What patterns explain it? (context)
     - Example: Survey shows diverse employees 69% more likely to leave → Interviews reveal they leave due to lack of psychological safety → Focus groups identify specific manager behaviors that undermine safety
  
  3. **Expansion**: Use one method to explain another
     - Example: Survey shows Unit A has higher turnover than Unit B → Interviews reveal Unit A managers interrupt diverse employees more frequently → Adds context to survey finding
  
  4. **Contradiction Resolution**: When methods disagree
     - Example: Managers say they're inclusive (survey) BUT diverse employees report exclusion (survey) AND interviews document specific exclusion examples → Trust employee data over manager self-report (managers may lack self-awareness or social desirability bias)
  
  **Integration Process:**
  
  **Step 1 - Analyze separately**: Complete survey analysis, interview analysis, focus group analysis independently
  
  **Step 2 - Create findings matrix**:
  | Finding | Survey Evidence | Interview Evidence | Focus Group Evidence | Convergence? |
  |---------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------|
  | Diverse employees excluded from key projects | 54% report monthly | 7 of 10 gave specific examples | All 6 groups mentioned | YES - STRONG |
  | Training receptiveness high | 78% managers support | 12 of 15 managers positive | 4 of 5 manager groups supportive | YES - STRONG |
  | Accountability concerns | 45% managers worried | 8 of 15 expressed concerns | 3 of 5 groups raised concerns | YES - MODERATE |
  
  **Step 3 - Synthesize by X→M→Y component**:
  - **X (Diversity exists)**: Survey + interview + focus group evidence that organization is diverse (38% diverse workforce)
  - **Problem (X→Y negative without M)**: Survey shows 27% vs. 16% turnover, interviews document why diverse employees leave, focus groups identify barriers → Confirms problem
  - **M mechanisms**: Survey shows low inclusion climate scores, interviews identify specific manager behaviors, focus groups reveal lack of accountability → Confirms M is weak
  - **Solution (M can improve Y)**: Survey shows training receptiveness, interviews reveal managers want tools, focus groups co-design training content → Supports solution
  
  **Step 4 - Compare to organizational data**: Do stakeholder reports match HR data?
  - Example: HR data shows 27% diverse turnover → Stakeholder interviews confirm intention to leave → VALIDATES organizational data isn't artifact
  
  **Step 5 - Compare to scientific evidence**: Do stakeholder experiences match research predictions?
  - Example: Scientific research says inclusion climate mediates diversity-performance → Stakeholder data confirms low inclusion climate → VALIDATES research applies to this context
  
  **Step 6 - Create integrated narrative**: Write synthesis that weaves together all evidence types
  - "Our stakeholder evidence VALIDATES the problem identified in organizational data AND aligns with scientific research predictions. Survey data shows 67% of diverse employees experience exclusion (n=102). Interviews provide depth: 'My manager makes decisions without consulting me' (Employee 7), 'I'm rarely invited to client meetings' (Employee 3). Focus groups identified patterns: exclusion is worse in male-dominated departments and among newer managers without training. This stakeholder evidence converges with organizational data (27% diverse turnover) and scientific research (Study 2: inclusion climate is THE critical mediator). Together, this evidence provides HIGH confidence that the problem is real, severe, and follows the X→M→Y pathway."
