## **STAKEHOLDER METHODS SUMMARY**

**Who We Asked:** 217 stakeholders across all organizational levels
- Senior leadership (10)—funding, commitment, accountability expectations
- Managers (50)—skill gaps, training needs, concerns about accountability
- High-performing inclusive managers (15)—exemplar behaviors for training design
- Diverse employees (150)—lived experiences, exclusion patterns, solution preferences

**How We Collected Data:**
- **Surveys:** Anonymous Qualtrics surveys (12-20 minutes)—quantified problem recognition, solution support, inclusion climate
- **Interviews:** Semi-structured 1:1 (30-90 minutes)—deeper dive on experiences, barriers, training needs
- **Focus groups:** 6 sessions with diverse employees (8-10 per group)—group dynamics, shared experiences
- **360-degree feedback:** Behavioral ratings of 180 managers—manager self-awareness vs. diverse employee perceptions

**Why Methods Are Credible:**
- **Multiple methods triangulate findings**—not relying on single data source
- **Anonymous feedback reduces social desirability bias**—employees can be honest
- **Representative sampling**—stratified by role, demographics, tenure (not just vocal minority)
- **Validated scales**—using peer-reviewed inclusion climate measures, not ad hoc questions

**Key Finding from Methods:** Manager self-awareness gap (self-rate 4.2 vs. 3.1 from diverse employees) validates need for behavioral training—managers don't realize behaviors aren't inclusive.

## **Detailed Stakeholder Evidence Methods**

## **Purpose of the Stakeholder Evidence Strategy**

**Primary Goal:** Understand lived experiences of diverse employees and managers within X→M→Y causal framework

**Specifically designed to determine:**
- **X→M Link:** How diverse employees experience daily workplace life when inclusion mechanisms (M) are strong versus weak
- **M Mechanisms:** Which specific manager behaviors create or inhibit inclusion
- **Barriers:** Day-to-day obstacles producing organizational patterns (27% vs. 16% turnover gap; 12-point engagement gap; 35% slower promotion rates)
- **Validation:** Whether employee and manager accounts confirm quantitative patterns and clarify underlying drivers

**Secondary Goal:** Evaluate and refine proposed solution (40-60 hour inclusive leadership training + accountability)

**Solution validation questions:**
- What do diverse employees want managers to do differently?
- What training content will managers find useful?
- What accountability mechanisms have credibility?
- What concerns must be addressed for successful implementation?


## **Stakeholder Groups and Engagement Methods**

**Stakeholder evidence collected across 217 individuals using structured mixed-methods approach (surveys, interviews, focus groups, 360-degree feedback). Sampling ensured representativeness, diversity of perspectives, and deep insight into X→M→Y mechanisms.**

### **Senior Leadership (n=10)**

**Why this group matters:** Fund, sponsor, sustain initiative; shape organizational norms; control performance/accountability structures; 100% support required for credibility

**Engagement methods:**
- 1:1 confidential interviews (60 minutes each)
- Focus: Commitment, concerns, resource allocation, expectations, risk assessment

**Response rate:** 100% (CEO secured mandatory participation)

### **Mid-Level Managers (n=50)**

**Why this group matters:** Directly create, reinforce, or fail to create inclusion mechanisms (M); they are the intervention target

**Engagement methods:**
- Online survey (15-20 minutes)—quantify skill gaps, training needs, concerns
- 15 semi-structured interviews (45 minutes)—deeper dive on barriers, accountability concerns
- Focus: Manager challenges, current behavior patterns, training content preferences, accountability fears

**Response rate:** 68% survey; 30% interviews (purposive sampling for depth)

### **High-Performing Inclusive Managers (n=15)**

**Why this group matters:** Serve as exemplars of strong inclusion mechanisms (M); provide behavioral models for training design

**Engagement methods:**
- 90-minute in-depth interviews—concrete behaviors, processes, strategies
- Optional meeting observations—see inclusive behaviors in action
- Focus: What do you do differently? What scripts/tools do you use? How do you interrupt bias in real-time?

**Response rate:** 100%

### **Diverse Employees (n=150)**

**Why this group matters:** Directly experience consequences of weak inclusion mechanisms; essential for validating X→M→Y and quantifying problem severity

**Engagement methods:**
- Anonymous online survey (12-15 minutes)—quantify exclusion frequency, turnover intentions, inclusion climate
- 6 stratified focus groups (8-10 participants each)—group dynamics, shared experiences, solution preferences
- 10 individual interviews (30-45 minutes)—deeper personal stories, career impact, specific manager behaviors
- Focus: Inclusion climate, exclusion experiences (frequency, types), access to opportunities, psychological safety, turnover intentions, what they want managers to do differently

**Response rate:** 57% survey; 50+ focus group participants

### **360-Degree Feedback (n=180 managers)**

**Why this matters:** Identifies manager self-awareness gap—do managers realize their behaviors aren't inclusive?

**Method:**
- Managers self-rate inclusion behaviors (1-5 scale)
- Direct reports (diverse employees) rate same managers on same behaviors (anonymous)
- Compare self-ratings vs. direct report ratings

**Key finding:** Managers self-rate 4.2; diverse employees rate them 3.1 (1.1-point gap = low self-awareness)

## **Data Collection Methods**

### **Surveys**

**Platform:** Qualtrics (anonymous, secure, advanced branching logic)

**Survey Length:**
- Managers: 30-35 questions (15-20 minutes)
- Employees: 25-30 questions (12-15 minutes)

**Survey Design:**
- **Validated scales:** Inclusion climate (8 items, α=0.91), psychological safety (7 items, α=0.89)—using peer-reviewed measures from research literature
- **Behavior-specific questions:** How often do you experience [interruption / idea dismissal / exclusion from networks]? (Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Rarely / Never)
- **Impact assessments:** Turnover intentions, engagement, performance confidence
- **Open-ended questions:** "What would you want your manager to do differently?" "What concerns do you have about accountability?"

**Why credible:** Anonymous (reduces social desirability bias), validated scales (not ad hoc questions), large sample (n=150 diverse employees, n=50 managers)

### **Interviews**

**Structure:** Semi-structured with core questions + flexibility for follow-up

**Sample questions:**
- "Describe a time when you felt excluded. What happened? What did your manager do or not do?"
- "What specific behaviors would make you feel more included?"
- "What concerns do you have about accountability for inclusion?"

**Why credible:** Depth and nuance beyond survey responses; opportunity to probe for specifics; builds trust through confidentiality

### **Focus Groups**

**Structure:** 6 sessions, stratified by:
- Gender (2 women-only, 2 men-only, 2 mixed)
- Race/ethnicity (intentionally diverse within each group)
- Tenure (mix of newer and longer-tenured employees)

**Facilitation:** External facilitator (not HR) to increase trust and candor

**Why credible:** Group dynamics surface shared experiences ("me too" moments validate patterns aren't isolated); anonymous transcription protects individual identity

## **Sampling Strategy**

**Purpose:** Ensure representativeness and avoid "vocal minority" bias

**Senior Leadership:** Census sampling (all 10 executives)

**Managers:** Stratified random sample
- Stratified by: department, tenure, team diversity composition
- Ensures mix of high-performing inclusive managers and those with inclusion gaps

**Diverse Employees:** Stratified purposive sampling
- Stratified by: race/ethnicity, gender, tenure, department
- Purposive: Oversampled employees in high vs. low inclusion units to compare experiences

**High-Performing Managers:** Purposive sampling
- Identified via 360-degree feedback (highest inclusion ratings from diverse employees)
- Provides exemplar behaviors for training design
- ERG/HR: Census

6. Recruitment & Engagement Strategy
- Personalized invitations from CEO/CHRO to signal importance
- Clear explanation of purpose and confidentiality
- Incentives for employees and departed staff
- Multiple reminders across email, intranet, and ERG networks
- Social proof language ("52% of your colleagues have responded")
