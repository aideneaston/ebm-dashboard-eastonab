1. Purpose of the Stakeholder Evidence Strategy
Primary Goal

The primary goal of stakeholder evidence gathering was to understand the lived experiences of diverse employees and their managers within the X→M→Y causal framework. Specifically, stakeholder engagement was designed to determine:
- X→M Link: How diverse employees experience daily workplace life when inclusion mechanisms (M) are strong versus weak.
- M Mechanisms: Which specific manager behaviors create or inhibit inclusion.
- Barriers: The day-to-day obstacles diverse employees face that produce the organizational patterns observed in the data (27% vs. 16% turnover gap; 12-point engagement gap; 35% slower promotion rates).
- Validation: Whether employee and manager accounts confirm the quantitative patterns and clarify the underlying drivers.

Secondary Goal

Stakeholder engagement also aimed to evaluate and refine the proposed solution: a 40–60 hour inclusive leadership training program paired with accountability mechanisms. The goal was to determine:
- What diverse employees want their managers to do differently
- What training content managers believe will be useful


2. Stakeholder Groups and Engagement Methods

Stakeholder evidence was collected across seven internal groups and limited external groups, using a structured mixed-methods approach (surveys, interviews, focus groups, observations). Sampling was structured to ensure representativeness, diversity of perspectives, and deep insight into the mechanisms underlying the X→M→Y pathway.

2.1 Senior Leadership (n=10)
- Why this group matters: They fund, sponsor, and sustain the initiative; shape organizational norms; and control performance/accountability structures.
- Engagement methods:
    - 1:1 confidential interviews (60 minutes each)
    - Focus: Commitment, concerns, resource allocation, expectations, risk assessment.
- Expected response: 100% (mandatory participation secured via CEO).

2.2 Mid-Level Managers (n=50)
- Why this group matters: They directly create, reinforce, or fail to create inclusion mechanisms (M).
- Engagement methods:
    - Online survey (15–20 minutes)
    - 15 semi-structured interviews (45 minutes)
    - Focus: Manager challenges, skill gaps, behavior patterns, training needs, concerns about accountability.
- Expected response: 65–70% for survey; 30% for interviews (purposive sampling).

2.3 High-Performing Inclusive Managers (n=15)
- Why this group matters: They serve as exemplars of strong inclusion mechanisms (M) and provide models for training design.
- Engagement methods:
    - 90-minute in-depth interviews
    - Optional meeting observations
    - Focus: Concrete behaviors, processes, and strategies that produce high inclusion climates.
- Expected response: 100%.

2.4 Diverse Employees (n=150)
- Why this group matters: They directly experience the consequences of weak inclusion mechanisms; essential for validating X→M→Y.
- Engagement methods:
    - Anonymous online survey (12–15 minutes)
    - 6 stratified focus groups (8–10 participants each)
    - 10 individual interviews (30–45 minutes)
    - Focus: Inclusion climate, exclusion experiences, access to opportunities, psychological safety, turnover intentions.
- Expected response: 55–60% survey; ~50 participants across focus groups.

3. External Stakeholder Inclusion (Limited)
3.1 Customers/Clients
- Included minimally—2–3 added questions within existing client feedback processes.
- Purpose: Determine whether internal inclusion issues spill into service delivery or brand reputation.

3.2 Suppliers/Partners
- Not engaged for this phase.
- Rationale: Limited visibility into internal inclusion mechanisms; not relevant to manager behavior change.

4. Data Collection Methods
4.1 Surveys
- Platform: Qualtrics (anonymous, secure, advanced logic).
- Length:
    - Managers: 30–35 questions (15–20 minutes)
    - Employees: 25–30 questions (12–15 minutes)
- Design:
    - 7-point Likert scales
    - Validated inclusion climate & psychological safety scales
    - Behavior-specific questions
    - Impact assessments
    - Open-ended questions for unexpected themes

5. Sampling Strategy
- Senior leadership: Census
- Managers: Stratified random sample
- Diverse employees: Stratified purposive sampling 
- High-performing managers: Purposive sampling
- Departed employees: Convenience sample
- ERG/HR: Census

6. Recruitment & Engagement Strategy
- Personalized invitations from CEO/CHRO to signal importance
- Clear explanation of purpose and confidentiality
- Incentives for employees and departed staff
- Multiple reminders across email, intranet, and ERG networks
- Social proof language ("52% of your colleagues have responded")
