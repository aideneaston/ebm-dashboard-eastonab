Internal Evidence Goals

Primary Goal
Collect internal data to establish baseline levels of:
- X (Diversity): Workforce and leadership composition
- M (Mechanisms): Training participation and inclusive leadership behaviors
- Y (Outcomes): Engagement, performance, innovation, and financial results

Then analyze whether meaningful relationships exist between X, M, and Y, and pinpoint where the X→M→Y pathway is breaking down (e.g., strong diversity but weak inclusion, or training with no impact on outcomes).

Secondary Goal
Assess solution feasibility by gathering data on:
- Organizational readiness and culture
- Manager capabilities, attitudes, and capacity
- Existing infrastructure and resources for training and accountability

This evidence should show whether the organization can realistically implement practitioner-recommended inclusive leadership training at scale.

Control Variables
To avoid misleading conclusions, analyses should control for:
- Team size, location, function, business unit, tenure (employee and manager), education where available, sector/line of business, and major external shocks (e.g., economic cycles).

Time Period
- Target 3–5 years of data where possible, with a minimum of 2 years for trend analysis.
- Use quarterly cuts when appropriate to see inflection points and seasonal patterns (e.g., hiring in Q1/Q3, turnover around bonus cycles, performance review timing).
- Establish a pre-intervention baseline (e.g., the most recent 12 months before any major inclusion training rollout) to support future pre/post comparisons.

Qualitative Data Collection

Internal Documents Review
- Policies & Processes: D&I, EEO, promotion, performance management, compensation, training requirements, and code of conduct.
- Leadership & Governance: Executive and board meeting minutes referencing diversity/inclusion, town hall transcripts, ERG reports.
- Communications & Feedback: Leadership messages about diversity, survey comments (especially from underrepresented groups), exit interview narratives, internal announcements about diversity programs and participation.
- Historical Evaluations: Reports on prior D&I initiatives, culture surveys, consulting assessments, and lessons learned.

Observational and Process Data
- Decision Processes: Observe promotion, hiring, and calibration discussions (who speaks, whose input carries weight, how criteria are applied).
- Workflows: How people actually get stretch roles, visibility, and sponsorship compared to formal processes.
- Informal Networks & Communication: Who is looped into key conversations; access to leaders; patterns in meetings (who speaks, gets interrupted, or is credited for ideas).
- Culture in Practice: Representation in visible spaces and events, recognition practices, observable micro-inclusions or microaggressions, comfort level of different groups in meetings and social spaces.

Access and Permissions

Data Access Strategy

Required Permissions
- Key Data Owners:
    - HR/CHRO (HRIS, surveys, performance, training)
    - Compensation and Finance (comp, payroll, training costs, financial performance)
    - Diversity/Compliance (EEO-1, prior D&I reporting)
    - L&D (training catalog and completions)
    - Customer/Marketing/Insights (customer metrics, where relevant)
- Approvals & Process:
    - Submit clear data requests stating: what is needed, why (X→M→Y analysis), how privacy is protected, and how data will be stored and used.
    - Involve Legal/Privacy for demographic and sensitive data, and secure an executive sponsor (ideally the CHRO and/or CEO) to support access.
- Privacy & Confidentiality:
    - Use de-identified, aggregated data; enforce minimum group sizes (e.g., 5–10 employees) for reporting.
    - De-identify qualitative data (comments, interviews).
    - Agree in writing to use data only for internal analysis, with secure storage and defined retention/destruction practices.

Contact Plan
- CHRO / HR Director – anchor sponsor for HRIS, survey, performance, succession, and training data.
- CFO / Finance Director – for team-level or unit-level financials and cost-of-turnover estimates.
- Chief Diversity Officer / D&I Lead – for historical program context, ERG information, and prior analysis.
- L&D Director – for training infrastructure, current offerings, capacity for inclusive leadership training.
- IT / Analytics Team – for data extraction, integration, and tools support.

Ethical Considerations
- Protect employee privacy and confidentiality at all stages.
- Follow organizational and legal data use policies strictly.
- Limit data to what is actually needed to answer the X→M→Y questions.
- Commit to aggregated reporting and avoid using demographic data in any way that could harm individuals or groups.
- Anonymize the organization and individuals if any results are ever used outside the company or class setting.

Data Analysis Plan
Establishing Baselines

X (Diversity):

Track diversity by level, function, and location over several years.

Identify when the organization reached current diversity levels and where representation drops (e.g., entry vs. leadership).

M (Mechanisms):

Baseline training coverage and depth (e.g., awareness-only vs. skills-based, one-and-done vs. ongoing).

Baseline manager inclusive behavior scores (where 360s exist).

Baseline frequency of equity-focused reviews (pay, promotion, assignments).

Y (Outcomes):

Normal operating ranges for engagement, turnover, promotion, innovation, productivity, and revenue per employee.

Define what “good” looks like internally and compare current values by demographic group.

Benchmarking

Compare organizational diversity to:

Labor market availability (Census/industry data), and

Industry peer diversity (from public reports, where available).

Compare performance metrics (turnover, engagement, revenue per employee) with industry benchmarks and survey vendor norms.

Analyzing the Problem

Indicators of a Diversity–Performance Gap (X→Y)
Look for patterns such as:
- Rising or strong workforce diversity, but:
    - Persistent or widening engagement gaps for underrepresented groups,
    - Much lower representation at leadership levels,
    - Higher turnover and slower promotions for diverse employees,
    - No corresponding lift in innovation or financial outcomes.

Indicators of Missing or Weak Mechanisms (M)
- Low or uneven participation in inclusive leadership training.
- Training that is mainly one-off awareness sessions with no behavior focus or follow-through.
- Limited or no accountability for inclusion in performance or pay decisions.
- Weak 360 scores or survey indicators on inclusion (psychological safety, voice, fairness).
- Feedback and exit narratives that consistently reference bias, exclusion, or lack of opportunity.

Quantifying Severity
- Engagement gaps (points difference between majority and underrepresented groups).
- Turnover ratios (diverse vs. majority turnover).
- Promotion and time-to-promotion gaps.
- Estimated cost of excess turnover and underperformance using standard cost-of-turnover ranges and revenue-per-employee gaps.

Testing the X→M→Y Pathway
Compare outcomes for:
- Teams with high diversity + high inclusion training/behavior scores
- Teams with high diversity + low inclusion metrics
- More homogeneous teams

Control for confounders (tenure, function, location, business unit performance, etc.) as much as possible.

Solution Feasibility Analysis

Resources and Infrastructure
- Budget: Current L&D and D&I spend; potential to reallocate or add investment for a pilot.
- Systems: LMS, HRIS, performance systems, and analytics capabilities needed to track X, M, and Y.
- People: L&D capacity to design/deliver training; HRBPs and D&I team capacity to support behavior change and accountability; analytics support.

Capability and Culture
- Managers: Baseline leadership effectiveness and openness to D&I; span of control and workload; historical responsiveness to prior initiatives.
- HR and D&I: Ability to interpret and act on data; credibility with the business; experience implementing change.
- Culture: Trust in leadership, openness to feedback, track record with past change efforts, and appetite for data-driven decision-making.
- Leadership Commitment: Evidence that executives and the board are willing to back a multi-year effort with real resources and accountability.

Risk Assessment
Identify and rate risks such as:
- Manager and employee resistance or backlash
- Budget or staffing constraints
- Weak data quality in key areas (e.g., demographics, team-level performance attribution)
- Legal or compliance concerns
- Lack of sustained leadership support

Then outline basic mitigation strategies (start with a pilot, involve Legal early, communicate clearly, frame the initiative as performance and culture-enhancing rather than punitive, etc.).

Documentation Strategy

Data Collection Log
Maintain a simple tracking log for:
- What was requested, from whom, when, and what was actually received
- Coverage (time period, org units) and key quality notes
- Any constraints or restrictions on use

Analysis Log
For each analysis step, document:
- The question, data used, methods, assumptions, findings, and limitations
- Enough detail that work can be replicated or revisited later

Quality Assurance

Check data totals and basic logic (e.g., headcount consistency, rates within plausible ranges).

Investigate outliers and inconsistencies.

Where possible, have a second person (or your “future self”) re-run key analyses or sanity-check results.

Triangulate numbers with qualitative findings and stakeholder feedback.

Version Control

Keep raw and processed data separate and clearly labeled.

Use a consistent folder and file naming convention with dates.

Track changes to analysis code or spreadsheets (even a simple changelog is helpful if you’re not using Git).

Expected Challenges & Backup Plans
Likely Challenges

Limited or incomplete demographic, historical, or team-level data.

Inconsistent definitions across time (turnover, job levels, departments).

Self-report and response biases in surveys and 360s.

Legal or political resistance to sharing sensitive data.

Time delays in getting access and completing complex integrations.

Workarounds and Minimum Viable Evidence

If ideal data are not available, fall back to:

Higher-level, aggregated metrics rather than team-level detail.

Using HR and survey data as primary Y outcomes even without full financial linkage.

Collecting new targeted survey or interview data if existing data are missing or outdated.

Focusing on directional evidence (e.g., “turnover is clearly higher for group X”) rather than perfectly precise estimates.

Even with imperfect data, you can still credibly say:

The organization has built some level of diversity (X).

There are signs of unequal outcomes (Y) for underrepresented groups.

Inclusion mechanisms (M) are patchy or underdeveloped.

Practitioner and research evidence suggest that systematic inclusive leadership training and accountability are likely to help.
