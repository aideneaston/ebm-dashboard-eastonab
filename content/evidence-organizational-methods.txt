# Organizational Evidence: Internal Data Collection Strategy
# Document your approach to gathering internal organizational evidence

## Internal Evidence Goals
**Primary Goal:** Collect internal organizational data to establish baseline diversity levels (X), current training program participation (M), and performance outcomes (Y), then analyze whether relationships exist between these variables within the organization. Need to quantify the current state of diversity-performance gap and identify where in the X→M→Y pathway breakdowns occur.

**Secondary Goal:** Gather internal data on solution feasibility - assess organizational readiness for inclusive leadership training implementation, identify resource constraints and opportunities, understand current manager capabilities and attitudes, and evaluate potential barriers to scaling training programs. Need data showing whether organization has infrastructure, culture, and leadership support to implement practitioner-recommended interventions.

## Available Data Sources

### Performance Metrics/KPIs
- **Financial Data:** Revenue per employee (Y outcome), department/team profitability, budget allocations for training and diversity programs, cost of turnover and recruitment

## Data Collection Plan

### Quantitative Data Collection
#### Metrics to Collect

**X Variable Metrics (Diversity):**
- Metric 1: Workforce diversity percentage by demographics - Current value: [Request from HRIS] - Data source: HRIS demographic data, EEO-1 reports
- Metric 2: Leadership diversity percentage (manager+ levels) - Current value: [Request from HRIS] - Data source: HRIS with job level filters
- Metric 3: Team-level diversity (Blau's index or similar) - Current value: [Calculate from HRIS] - Data source: HRIS employee demographics by team/department
- Metric 4: Diversity in high-potential pools - Current value: [Request from talent review] - Data source: Succession planning/talent review documents
- Metric 5: Hiring diversity rates (% diverse hires) - Current value: [Request from recruiting] - Data source: HRIS applicant tracking system

**Control Variables (Confounds to Account For):**
- Team size, team tenure, industry sector, geographic location, job function, business unit performance, manager tenure, employee seniority distribution, education levels, external market conditions during measurement period

#### Time Period Analysis
- **Historical Data Range:** Collect 3-5 years of historical data if available to establish trends and baseline patterns. Minimum 2 years needed for meaningful diversity-performance analysis. Practitioner evidence suggests 18-24 months to see training impacts, so need pre/post data spanning this timeframe.
- **Trend Analysis Period:** Analyze quarterly trends over past 2-3 years to identify whether diversity-performance gap is widening, stable, or narrowing. Look for inflection points coinciding with diversity initiatives, leadership changes, or market shifts.
- **Seasonal Considerations:** Account for hiring cycle patterns (often Q1 and Q3 heavy), annual performance review timing (affects promotion and turnover data), end-of-year budget impacts, summer vacation effects on productivity. Retail/seasonal businesses need industry-specific adjustments.
- **Baseline Period:** Establish baseline from most recent 12 months before any major diversity intervention was implemented, or if no intervention exists, use most recent complete year. Need "pre-training" baseline to eventually measure training impact if organization proceeds with M intervention.

### Qualitative Data Collection
#### Internal Documents Review
- **Policy Documents:** Current diversity and inclusion policies, equal employment opportunity policies, promotion and compensation policies (look for potential bias points), performance evaluation criteria and processes, training requirements and policies, code of conduct regarding inclusion
- **Meeting Minutes:** Executive team discussions of diversity initiatives, board diversity committee minutes, town hall Q&A on diversity topics, employee resource group (ERG) meeting notes, manager meetings discussing talent decisions
- **Communication Records:** CEO/leadership communications on diversity commitments, employee survey open-ended comments (especially from underrepresented employees), exit interview narratives (analyze for inclusion themes), internal diversity program announcements and participation data
- **Project Reports:** Evaluation reports from previous diversity training programs (what worked/didn't work), past diversity initiative outcomes and lessons learned, HR program evaluation reports, consulting reports on organizational culture or diversity

#### Observational Data
- **Process Observations:** Observe promotion decision meetings (who speaks, whose opinions count, criteria applied), hiring panel discussions (watch for bias in candidate evaluation), performance review calibration sessions (look for disparate treatment patterns), team meetings (who participates, whose ideas get credited)
- **Workflow Analysis:** Map how talent decisions actually made vs. stated policy, identify where subjective judgment enters processes (potential bias points), document who has influence over high-visibility project assignments, trace how mentorship and sponsorship relationships form
- **Communication Patterns:** Analyze who is included in important email threads and meetings, examine informal network patterns (lunch groups, after-work socializing), document access to senior leaders by employee demographics, observe whose questions get answered in all-hands meetings
- **Cultural Observations:** Note representation in visible spaces (office photos, website, marketing), observe celebration of different cultural events, watch for microaggression patterns or exclusionary behaviors, assess comfort level of diverse employees in group settings, notice who sits together in cafeteria/common areas

## Access and Permissions

### Data Access Strategy
#### Required Permissions
- **Data Custodians:** HRIS data controlled by HR Director/CHRO, compensation data by Compensation team and CFO, performance data by HR Business Partners and managers, financial data by Finance Director/CFO, EEO-1 reports by Chief Diversity Officer or HR Compliance, training data by Learning & Development Director, customer data by Chief Marketing Officer
- **Approval Process:** Submit formal data request to HR leadership outlining: (1) specific data needed, (2) business purpose (analyzing diversity-performance relationship), (3) privacy protections (aggregated analysis, no individual identification), (4) data security measures, (5) use limitations (internal analysis only, not external sharing). May require Legal and Privacy Officer approval for demographic data. Executive sponsor (ideally CHRO or CEO) approval strengthens request.
- **Privacy Considerations:** Must comply with employment law restrictions on demographic data use, GDPR if applicable for international employees, state-specific privacy laws (California CPRA). Can only use demographic data for legitimate business purposes (analyzing equity, not discriminating). Cannot share individual-level demographic data externally. Must aggregate data to prevent individual identification (minimum cell size of 5-10 employees per analysis group). Need to de-identify employee survey comments.
- **Confidentiality Requirements:** Sign data use agreement restricting data to internal analysis only, committing to aggregated reporting, agreeing to secure data storage, promising data destruction after analysis. May need IRB approval if treating as research for publication. Obtain employee notification/consent if required by policy or law.

#### Contact Plan
1. **Primary Contact:** Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) or HR Director
   - **Data Sources:** HRIS employee demographics, job levels, hire/termination dates, performance ratings, promotion history, compensation data (in partnership with Finance), employee survey results, training records, manager assessments, EEO-1 reports
   - **Approach:** Schedule meeting to present research objectives (evidence-based analysis of diversity-performance relationship using X→M→Y framework). Explain connection to organizational goals (improving performance through inclusion). Present practitioner evidence showing ROI of inclusive leadership training. Request aggregated, de-identified data for analysis. Offer to share findings to support organizational decision-making. Emphasize privacy protections and confidentiality commitments.

2. **Secondary Contact:** Chief Financial Officer (CFO) or Finance Director
   - **Data Sources:** Team/department financial performance data, revenue per employee, budget data for training programs, cost of turnover, profitability by business unit
   - **Approach:** Request meeting through HR sponsor (CHRO) to discuss business case for diversity investment. Explain need for financial performance data to assess Y outcomes in X→M→Y model. Emphasize aggregated analysis at team/department level, no individual data needed. Offer to help quantify ROI of potential inclusive leadership training investment based on practitioner evidence ($75M-$84M turnover cost reductions, 15-22% innovation improvements in case studies).

3. **Tertiary Contacts:** 
   - **Chief Diversity Officer:** Diversity program history, previous initiatives, current strategy, ERG data, inclusion survey results
   - **Learning & Development Director:** Training completion data, program evaluations, manager development program details, available training infrastructure
   - **IT/Data Analytics Team:** Technical assistance accessing systems, data extraction, analytics platform support, dashboard creation

### Ethical Considerations
- **Employee Privacy:** Analyze only aggregated data - no analysis of individual employees by name. Minimum cell size of 5-10 employees per demographic group to prevent identification. Do not combine multiple demographic categories that could uniquely identify individuals (e.g., "Asian female VP in Marketing" in small org). De-identify all qualitative data (survey comments, exit interviews). Obtain only data necessary for analysis, not extraneous personal information. Comply with all applicable employment privacy laws.
- **Data Security:** Store data on password-protected, encrypted systems. Limit access to data to authorized analysts only. Do not transmit sensitive data via unencrypted email. Delete individual-level data after aggregation completed. Maintain data only as long as needed for analysis, then securely dispose. Use secure organization systems rather than personal devices. Follow organization's data classification and security policies.
- **Use Limitations:** Use data solely for stated purpose (analyzing diversity-performance relationship to inform organizational decision-making). Do not use demographic data for any employment decisions affecting individuals. Do not share data with unauthorized parties. Do not repurpose data for other projects without new approval. Do not sell or commercialize organizational data. If publishing findings, obtain organization approval and ensure no proprietary information disclosed.
- **Reporting Boundaries:** Internal reporting: Can share aggregated findings with organizational leadership and stakeholders who approved data access. Must maintain confidentiality of sensitive business information. External reporting: Cannot share individual-level data or data that could identify organization without explicit permission. Can share high-level insights ("organization has X% diversity, Y performance gap") only with anonymization. Academic or public presentation requires organization approval and anonymization of company identity. Must respect competitive confidentiality - no disclosure of proprietary metrics or strategies.

## Data Analysis Plan

### Baseline Establishment
#### Pre-Problem Baselines
**Diversity baseline (X):** Establish historical diversity percentages by job level over past 3-5 years. Identify when organization reached current diversity levels. Calculate diversity growth rate. Determine if diversity increased but performance didn't improve proportionally (suggesting X→Y gap).

**Training baseline (M):** Document what diversity/inclusion training currently exists. Calculate current manager participation rates. Assess current inclusive leadership behavior scores from 360 feedback if available. Establish baseline for how often managers review team equity patterns.

**Performance baseline (Y):** Establish normal operating ranges for: employee engagement scores (overall and by demographics), turnover rates (overall and by demographics), innovation metrics (ideas per employee, new products launched), productivity metrics (output per employee), revenue per employee, customer satisfaction. Identify what "good performance" looks like historically.

#### Normal Operating Ranges
**Engagement:** Historical range (e.g., 65-75% favorable), target (80%+), current by demographics to identify gaps
**Turnover:** Industry benchmark (e.g., 10-15% annual for knowledge work), organizational historical rate, acceptable range, current by demographics to identify disparities
**Innovation:** Historical idea submission rates, implementation rates, patent/publication counts, benchmark against top-performing teams
**Productivity:** Historical output per FTE, industry productivity benchmarks if available, top-quartile internal teams for comparison
**Revenue:** Historical revenue per employee trends, industry benchmarks from financial databases, variance by business unit

#### Benchmark Comparisons
**Diversity benchmarks:** Compare organizational diversity % to U.S. labor market availability (from Census ABS data analyzed earlier: 39.8% women-owned businesses, 18.7% minority-owned businesses as reference). Compare to industry peers using published diversity reports from competitors. Compare leadership diversity to workforce diversity (representation gap).

**Performance benchmarks:** Use industry standards from Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for turnover rates by industry. Compare engagement scores to survey vendor norms and industry benchmarks (often provided by vendors like Gallup, Qualtrics). Compare financial performance (revenue per employee, margins) to industry averages from financial databases. Reference the dataset analysis showing high-training firms (80%+) had $108K revenue per employee vs. $55K for low-training firms.

### Problem Evidence Analysis
#### Problem Indicators
**Confirms X→Y gap (diversity without performance):**
- Organization has increasing workforce diversity BUT engagement scores flat or declining among diverse employees
- Diversity at entry levels BUT homogeneous leadership (representation gap between workforce and management)
- Diverse teams exist BUT innovation metrics (ideas submitted, patents filed) no higher than homogeneous teams
- Hiring diverse talent BUT turnover rates significantly higher for underrepresented employees (suggests "revolving door")
- Diverse customer base BUT customer satisfaction not higher in areas served by diverse teams
- Financial performance not improving despite diversity investments

**Confirms missing M (inclusion mechanisms):**
- Managers have not completed inclusive leadership training OR training was one-time awareness without behavior focus
- No accountability structures (diversity metrics not in manager performance reviews or compensation)
- No systematic equity audits (managers don't review promotion/compensation/assignment patterns by demographics)
- 360 feedback shows low manager scores on inclusive leadership behaviors
- Employee surveys show low psychological safety or inclusion climate scores
- Diverse employees report not having "voice" in decisions or access to developmental opportunities

#### Problem Severity Measurement
**Quantify performance gaps by demographics:**
- Calculate engagement score gap: (Average score for underrepresented employees) - (Average score for majority employees). Gap >5-10 points indicates significant problem.
- Calculate turnover rate ratio: (Turnover rate for underrepresented employees) / (Turnover rate for majority employees). Ratio >1.2 indicates 20%+ higher turnover, significant problem.
- Calculate promotion velocity gap: (Average years to promotion for underrepresented) - (Average years for majority). Gap >1 year indicates systematic advancement disparity.
- Calculate "diversity penalty" in performance: Compare team performance metrics for diverse teams vs. homogeneous teams at similar diversity levels to industry benchmarks. If diverse teams underperforming potential, quantify gap.

**Estimate financial impact:**
- Cost of excess turnover: (Turnover rate gap) × (Number of diverse employees) × (Cost per turnover = typically 50-200% of salary)
- Lost innovation value: Estimate foregone innovation from disengaged diverse employees. Practitioner evidence suggests 15-27% innovation gap.
- Revenue opportunity cost: If diverse teams could perform at benchmark levels (like high-training firms in dataset at $108K per employee), calculate gap from current performance

#### Root Cause Investigation
**Analyze where in X→M→Y pathway breakdown occurs:**
1. **Do we have X (diversity)?** Calculate diversity % by level, function, location. If low diversity at hiring, root cause is recruiting. If diversity drops at higher levels, root cause is retention/advancement.

2. **Do we have M (inclusion mechanisms)?** 
   - Query training system: What % of managers completed inclusive leadership training? When? Was it behavior-focused or awareness-only?
   - Analyze 360 feedback: Do managers demonstrate inclusive behaviors (soliciting diverse perspectives, equitable recognition, bias interruption)?
   - Check accountability: Are diversity metrics in performance reviews? Tied to compensation?
   - Review processes: Are promotion/hiring processes structured (bias interrupters) or subjective?

3. **Do we see M→Y relationship?** 
   - Correlate manager inclusive behavior scores with team outcomes (engagement, innovation, turnover). Do high-inclusion managers have better team performance?
   - Compare teams where managers completed training vs. not. Do trained managers' teams show better outcomes?
   - Analyze if teams with high diversity AND high manager inclusion outperform teams with high diversity but low inclusion (tests if M mediates X→Y)

**Identify confounding factors:**
- Control for team size, industry sector, geographic location, tenure, education levels
- Check if performance gaps existed before diversity increased (alternative explanation)
- Look for organizational factors beyond manager behavior (systems, policies, resources) affecting outcomes

### Solution Feasibility Analysis
#### Resource Assessment
**Budget availability:** Review training budget - current spend on L&D programs, budget allocation process, whether incremental funding available or requires reallocation. Practitioner evidence suggests large orgs spend $100M-$300M over 5 years, but can start with pilot ($1M-$5M). Calculate as % of HR budget (recommended 1-2% for mature programs).

**Existing infrastructure:** Inventory current training delivery capability (LMS platform, facilitators, virtual training tools), HR analytics capability (can track metrics by demographics?), performance management system capability (can add inclusive leadership competencies?), compensation system flexibility (can tie bonuses to diversity metrics?).

**Staff capacity:** Count L&D staff who could design/deliver training, HR business partners who could support manager accountability, diversity team size and capability, IT/analytics support for dashboard creation, project management resources for implementation.

**Opportunity cost analysis:** Calculate manager time required (40+ hours year 1 per practitioner evidence) × (number of managers) × (average manager hourly cost). Assess if this time can be absorbed or requires backfill. Consider trade-offs with other priorities.

#### Capability Assessment
**Manager readiness:** Analyze manager effectiveness scores - baseline capability level. Review span of control - do managers have manageable team sizes to practice inclusion? Check manager tenure and stability - high manager turnover risks training investment. Survey manager attitudes toward diversity (predict receptivity vs. resistance). Identify manager champions who could pilot program.

**HR capability:** Assess HR team's data analytics skills (can they track diversity metrics and analyze patterns?). Evaluate HR credibility with business (can they drive accountability?). Review HR's track record delivering other change initiatives. Check if HR has executive support for diversity initiatives.

**Organizational culture:** Review employee survey data for culture indicators: openness to change, trust in leadership, psychological safety scores, innovation orientation. Analyze previous change initiative success rates. Check if culture is data-driven (receptive to evidence-based approach) or relationship-driven. Identify culture barriers (risk aversion, hierarchical decision-making, siloed functions) that could impede implementation.

**Leadership commitment:** Document executive statements on diversity (words vs. actions gap?). Check if diversity metrics reviewed in business reviews. Analyze if executives tie own compensation to diversity ("skin in the game"). Review board oversight of diversity. Identify executive champions and potential resisters.

#### Risk Assessment
**Implementation risks revealed by internal data:**

**Manager resistance risk:** HIGH if manager survey shows low diversity importance ratings, previous diversity initiatives faced pushback, managers lack time for training, command-and-control culture. Mitigate by pilot with champions, tie to performance management, frame as skill-building not compliance.

**Resource constraint risk:** HIGH if budget cuts planned, competing priorities (merger, restructuring), L&D team understaffed. Mitigate by starting small (pilot with 50-100 managers), leveraging external consultants, demonstrating quick wins to secure continued funding.

**Measurement risk:** HIGH if HRIS lacks reliable demographic data, systems can't track diversity metrics, small employee counts preventing aggregated analysis. Mitigate by investing in data quality first, using proxy measures, focusing on qualitative indicators if quantitative insufficient.

**Legal/compliance risk:** Review litigation history - any employment discrimination claims suggesting hostile environment? Check if legal/compliance team supportive or risk-averse. Assess if strong documentation practices exist (protect against claims). Mitigate by involving legal early, ensuring training teaches legal requirements, building equity into processes.

**Backlash risk:** Analyze employee sentiment data - majority employee openness to diversity? Previous initiatives caused backlash? Vocal opponents in organization? Mitigate by transparent communication, emphasizing inclusion benefits ALL employees, avoiding zero-sum framing, celebrating early wins.

**Sustainability risk:** Check executive tenure stability - leadership changes could derail long-term initiative. Review organizational track record maintaining initiatives beyond initial enthusiasm. Assess if diversity embedded in strategy or separate. Mitigate by institutionalizing practices (policies, systems), building cross-functional ownership, creating measurement cadence.

## Documentation Strategy

### Data Collection Log
Create spreadsheet tracking: (1) Data element requested, (2) Data source/custodian, (3) Date requested, (4) Date received, (5) Data timeframe/completeness, (6) Data quality notes, (7) Access restrictions/confidentiality level, (8) Storage location. Update weekly. Share with faculty advisor/project sponsor.

### Analysis Documentation
Maintain analysis log documenting: (1) Analysis question, (2) Data sources used, (3) Analysis method (descriptive stats, correlation, regression, etc.), (4) Assumptions made, (5) Findings, (6) Limitations/caveats, (7) Date completed. Create one log entry per analysis. Store in shared repository. Use Jupyter notebooks or R Markdown for reproducible analysis with code, output, and narrative integrated.

### Quality Assurance
**Data validation:** Cross-check data against published sources (EEO-1 reports, annual reports). Verify totals match (e.g., sum of employees by demographics = total headcount). Check for outliers and investigate. Compare data to prior periods for consistency. Spot-check samples of individual records if accessible.

**Analysis validation:** Have second analyst reproduce key findings. Conduct sensitivity analysis (do findings hold with different assumptions/methods?). Triangulate quantitative findings with qualitative data. Present preliminary findings to organizational stakeholders for "reality check" - do findings match their experience?

### Version Control
Use version control system (Git) for analysis code. Name data files with dates (diversity_data_2025-11-21.csv). Maintain changelog documenting each data update. Archive superseded versions. Use consistent folder structure (raw_data/, processed_data/, analysis/, outputs/). Back up to cloud storage. Never edit raw data files - create processed versions.

## Expected Challenges

### Data Availability
**Likely unavailable:** Team-level financial performance (often aggregated only at division level), individual manager inclusive behavior scores (360 feedback may not exist or be restricted), historical diversity data beyond 2-3 years (HRIS systems often replaced, data lost), training effectiveness data (completion tracked but not behavior change or outcomes), customer demographics matched to account teams (CRM may lack this granularity).

**Workarounds:** Use division-level data as proxy, conduct new manager 360 assessment as baseline, accept shorter historical window, implement prospective tracking, survey sample of customers.

### Data Quality Issues
**Demographic data incomplete:** Many employees decline to self-report race/ethnicity/gender in HRIS. Missing data 10-30% typical. Imputation inappropriate (legal risks). Report as "unknown" category, caveat findings. Consider voluntary demographic survey if participation higher.

**Inconsistent definitions:** Turnover calculated differently across years (voluntary only vs. all terminations, annualized vs. period), job levels re-categorized over time, departments reorganized making longitudinal comparison difficult. Document definition changes, adjust historical data for consistency where possible, note limitations where impossible.

**Self-report bias:** Employee surveys subject to response bias (happier employees respond more, fear of retaliation suppresses honest feedback), 360 feedback subject to rater bias, exit interviews may not reveal true departure reasons. Caveat findings, triangulate with objective data (actual turnover vs. survey intentions).

**Small sample sizes:** Organization or teams too small for demographic analysis meeting minimum cell size (5-10 employees). Cannot disaggregate by race/ethnicity and gender simultaneously. May only analyze gender (larger N). Note limitation, focus on qualitative data.

### Access Barriers
**Legal/privacy concerns:** Legal team may restrict demographic data access citing discrimination risk, privacy laws, or litigation concerns. Mitigate by: involving legal early to design compliant approach, obtaining executive sponsor to authorize access, committing to aggregated analysis only, signing data use agreement, proposing independent third-party analysis if internal access denied.

**Political resistance:** Stakeholders may resist sharing data showing negative findings (performance gaps, turnover disparities, engagement issues). Mitigate by: framing as improvement opportunity not blame, securing executive mandate for transparency, emphasizing confidentiality of findings, focusing on organization-level patterns not individual leader accountability.

**Technical barriers:** Data in incompatible systems, no analytics tools to merge datasets, IT resources unavailable. Mitigate by: requesting data extracts to CSV, using Excel or free tools (R, Python) for analysis, enlisting IT support early, accepting manual data integration if necessary.

### Time Constraints
**Data request delays:** HR and Finance teams have day-job priorities, data requests queue for weeks or months. Mitigate by: submitting requests early, clearly communicating urgency and executive support, building relationships with data custodians, offering to do data extraction/analysis work yourself if given system access.

**Analysis complexity:** Merging datasets, cleaning data, conducting sophisticated analysis time-intensive. May require months. Mitigate by: starting with simple descriptive analysis (current state), iterating to more complex analysis (correlations, causality), accepting "good enough" rather than perfect, leveraging existing analysis (HR analytics team may have done similar).

## Backup Plans

### Alternative Data Sources
**If HRIS data inaccessible:** Request aggregated data only ("% women at each level" rather than individual records). Use publicly available EEO-1 data (if organization files publicly). Survey employees directly for demographic and experience data (voluntary). Use organizational charts to manually code diversity by observable characteristics (imperfect but sometimes only option).

**If financial performance data inaccessible:** Use publicly available data for public companies (annual reports, SEC filings). Request non-financial performance data (productivity metrics, quality scores, customer satisfaction). Focus on HR metrics (engagement, turnover) as Y outcomes - still valid performance indicators.

**If manager behavior data unavailable:** Survey employees about manager inclusive behaviors (substitute for 360). Analyze observable behaviors (meeting participation patterns, project assignments, promotion recommendations). Focus on systems/processes rather than individual managers (are structured processes in place?).

### Proxy Measures
**If direct diversity metrics limited:** Use hiring source diversity (schools recruited, referral patterns) as leading indicator. Use ERG participation rates. Analyze diversity of finalist pools for promotions even if promotion outcomes unavailable. Use retention rates as outcome measure (if diverse employees stay, suggests inclusion even without engagement surveys).

**If innovation metrics unavailable:** Use proxy indicators like patent filing rates, new product launches, process improvement submissions. Survey employees on "my ideas are heard and implemented" as perception measure. Analyze project team composition and success rates.

**If team-level data unavailable:** Aggregate to department or division level. Accept coarser analysis. Or conduct deep-dive case studies on few teams with willing managers (qualitative over quantitative).

### Simplified Analysis
**Minimum viable organizational evidence:**

1. **Current state description:** Basic workforce demographics by level (even if just gender and aggregated race/ethnicity due to small N). Directional information ("underrepresented at leadership levels") even without precise percentages.

2. **Performance gap indication:** Any evidence of outcome disparities - turnover higher for diverse employees, engagement scores lower, promotion rates slower. Even anecdotal data from exit interviews or survey comments if quantitative unavailable.

3. **Mechanism assessment:** Qualitative assessment of whether M (inclusion mechanisms) exist - Do managers have inclusion training? Is there accountability? Are there bias interrupters in processes? Can be descriptive rather than quantitative.

4. **Feasibility indicators:** Budget availability (yes/no), leadership support (supportive/neutral/opposed), existing infrastructure (adequate/needs development).

With this minimum viable evidence, can still make case: "We have workforce diversity (X) but gaps suggest we're not fully leveraging it (Y). We lack systematic inclusion mechanisms (M). Practitioner evidence shows M is critical mediator. We have feasibility to implement. Therefore recommend proceeding with inclusive leadership training pilot."

Perfect data not required - directionally correct evidence sufficient for decision-making. Acknowledge limitations transparently.
