Reports and Documentation
- Regular Reports: EEO-1, diversity dashboards, engagement survey summaries, turnover reports, performance review summaries, training completion reports, business unit performance reviews.
- Survey Results: Engagement and inclusion surveys, 360 manager feedback, pulse surveys, exit interviews.
- Audits & Assessments: Pay equity audits, hiring/promotion process reviews, HR compliance audits, training evaluations, culture and organizational assessments.
- Historical Studies: Earlier diversity initiatives, retention or turnover studies, benchmarking reports, prior internal analytics projects on team performance and composition.

Data Collection Plan

Quantitative Data Collection

X (Diversity) Metrics
- Workforce diversity % by demographic group (overall and by level/function/location)
- Leadership diversity (manager and above)
- Team-level diversity indices (e.g., Blau index)

M (Mechanisms) Metrics
- Manager completion rate of inclusive leadership and D&I training
- 360 scores on inclusive leadership behaviors
- Total and type of diversity/inclusion training hours per manager

Y (Outcome) Metrics
- Team/segment innovation (ideas submitted/implemented, innovation output per team)
- Engagement scores by team and demographics
- Turnover by demographics and team, including early-tenure turnover
- Productivity (output per employee or per FTE)

Control Variables
To avoid misleading conclusions, analyses should control for:
- Team size, location, function, business unit, tenure (employee and manager), education where available, sector/line of business, and major external shocks (e.g., economic cycles).

Time Period
- Target 3–5 years of data where possible, with a minimum of 2 years for trend analysis.
- Use quarterly cuts when appropriate to see inflection points and seasonal patterns (e.g., hiring in Q1/Q3, turnover around bonus cycles, performance review timing).
- Establish a pre-intervention baseline (e.g., the most recent 12 months before any major inclusion training rollout) to support future pre/post comparisons.

Qualitative Data Collection

Internal Documents Review
- Policies & Processes: D&I, EEO, promotion, performance management, compensation, training requirements, and code of conduct.
- Leadership & Governance: Executive and board meeting minutes referencing diversity/inclusion, town hall transcripts, ERG reports.
- Communications & Feedback: Leadership messages about diversity, survey comments (especially from underrepresented groups), exit interview narratives, internal announcements about diversity programs and participation.
- Historical Evaluations: Reports on prior D&I initiatives, culture surveys, consulting assessments, and lessons learned.

Observational and Process Data
- Decision Processes: Observe promotion, hiring, and calibration discussions (who speaks, whose input carries weight, how criteria are applied).
- Workflows: How people actually get stretch roles, visibility, and sponsorship compared to formal processes.
- Informal Networks & Communication: Who is looped into key conversations; access to leaders; patterns in meetings (who speaks, gets interrupted, or is credited for ideas).
- Culture in Practice: Representation in visible spaces and events, recognition practices, observable micro-inclusions or microaggressions, comfort level of different groups in meetings and social spaces.

Access and Permissions

Data Access Strategy

Required Permissions
- Key Data Owners:
    - HR/CHRO (HRIS, surveys, performance, training)
    - Compensation and Finance 
    - Diversity/Compliance 
    - L&D (training catalog and completions)
    - Customer/Marketing/Insights (
- Approvals & Process:
    - Submit clear data requests stating: what is needed, why (X→M→Y analysis), how privacy is protected, and how data will be stored and used.
    - Involve Legal/Privacy for demographic and sensitive data, and secure an executive sponsor (ideally the CHRO and/or CEO) to support access.
- Privacy & Confidentiality:
    - Use de-identified, aggregated data; enforce minimum group sizes (e.g., 5–10 employees) for reporting.
    - De-identify qualitative data (comments, interviews).
    - Agree in writing to use data only for internal analysis, with secure storage and defined retention/destruction practices.

Contact Plan
- CHRO / HR Director – anchor sponsor for HRIS, survey, performance, succession, and training data.
- CFO / Finance Director – for team-level or unit-level financials and cost-of-turnover estimates.
- Chief Diversity Officer / D&I Lead – for historical program context, ERG information, and prior analysis.
- L&D Director – for training infrastructure, current offerings, capacity for inclusive leadership training.
- IT / Analytics Team – for data extraction, integration, and tools support.

Ethical Considerations
- Protect employee privacy and confidentiality at all stages.
- Follow organizational and legal data use policies strictly.
- Limit data to what is actually needed to answer the X→M→Y questions.
- Commit to aggregated reporting and avoid using demographic data in any way that could harm individuals or groups.
- Anonymize the organization and individuals if any results are ever used outside the company or class setting.

Data Analysis Plan
Establishing Baselines

X (Diversity):
      - Track diversity by level, function, and location over several years.
      - Identify when the organization reached current diversity levels and where representation drops (e.g., entry vs. leadership).

M (Mechanisms):
      - Baseline training coverage and depth (e.g., awareness-only vs. skills-based, one-and-done vs. ongoing).
      - Baseline manager inclusive behavior scores (where 360s exist).
      - Baseline frequency of equity-focused reviews (pay, promotion, assignments).

- Y (Outcomes):
    - Normal operating ranges for engagement, turnover, promotion, innovation, productivity, and revenue per employee.
    - Define what "good" looks like internally and compare current values by demographic group.

Benchmarking
- Compare organizational diversity to:
    - Labor market availability (Census/industry data), and
    - Industry peer diversity (from public reports, where available).
- Compare performance metrics (turnover, engagement, revenue per employee) with industry benchmarks and survey vendor norms.

Analyzing the Problem

Indicators of a Diversity–Performance Gap (X→Y)
Look for patterns such as:
- Rising or strong workforce diversity, but:
    - Persistent or widening engagement gaps for underrepresented groups,
    - Much lower representation at leadership levels,
    - Higher turnover and slower promotions for diverse employees,
    - No corresponding lift in innovation or financial outcomes.

Indicators of Missing or Weak Mechanisms (M)
- Low or uneven participation in inclusive leadership training.
- Training that is mainly one-off awareness sessions with no behavior focus or follow-through.
- Limited or no accountability for inclusion in performance or pay decisions.
- Weak 360 scores or survey indicators on inclusion (psychological safety, voice, fairness).

Quantifying Severity
- Engagement gaps (points difference between majority and underrepresented groups).
- Turnover ratios (diverse vs. majority turnover).
- Promotion and time-to-promotion gaps.
- Estimated cost of excess turnover and underperformance using standard cost-of-turnover ranges and revenue-per-employee gaps.

Testing the X→M→Y Pathway
Compare outcomes for:
- Teams with high diversity + high inclusion training/behavior scores
- Teams with high diversity + low inclusion metrics
- More homogeneous teams

Solution Feasibility Analysis

Resources and Infrastructure
- Budget: Current L&D and D&I spend; potential to reallocate or add investment for a pilot.
- Systems: LMS, HRIS, performance systems, and analytics capabilities needed to track X, M, and Y.
- People: L&D capacity to design/deliver training; HRBPs and D&I team capacity to support behavior change and accountability; analytics support.

Capability and Culture
- Managers: Baseline leadership effectiveness and openness to D&I; span of control and workload; historical responsiveness to prior initiatives.
- HR and D&I: Ability to interpret and act on data; credibility with the business; experience implementing change.
- Culture: Trust in leadership, openness to feedback, track record with past change efforts, and appetite for data-driven decision-making.
- Leadership Commitment: Evidence that executives and the board are willing to back a multi-year effort with real resources and accountability.

Risk Assessment
Identify and rate risks such as:
- Manager and employee resistance or backlash
- Budget or staffing constraints
- Weak data quality in key areas 
- Legal or compliance concerns
- Lack of sustained leadership support

Documentation Strategy

Data Collection Log
Maintain a simple tracking log for:
- What was requested, from whom, when, and what was actually received
- Coverage (time period, org units) and key quality notes
- Any constraints or restrictions on use

Analysis Log
For each analysis step, document:
- The question, data used, methods, assumptions, findings, and limitations
- Enough detail that work can be replicated or revisited later

Quality Assurance

- Check data totals and basic logic (e.g., headcount consistency, rates within plausible ranges).
- Investigate outliers and inconsistencies.
- Where possible, have a second person (or your "future self") re-run key analyses or sanity-check results.
- Triangulate numbers with qualitative findings and stakeholder feedback.
