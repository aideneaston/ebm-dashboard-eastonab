## ORGANIZATIONAL METHODS SUMMARY

**What Data We Collected:**
- **HRIS data (2022 full-year)**—demographics, turnover, promotions, compensation (disaggregated by race/ethnicity, gender)
- **Engagement surveys**—inclusion climate items, psychological safety, belonging (annual survey, n=3,200+ responses)
- **Training records**—who completed diversity/inclusion training, hours, dates (from Learning Management System)
- **Financial data**—revenue per FTE by unit, turnover costs, training costs (from financial systems)
- **360-degree feedback**—manager inclusive behaviors rated by diverse employees (n=180 managers)

**How We Analyzed It:**
- **Compared high-inclusion vs. low-inclusion units**—units where ≥80% managers completed 40-hour program (high) vs. <70% completion (low)
- **Disaggregated by demographics**—separate turnover/engagement/promotion rates for diverse employees vs. majority employees
- **Temporal sequencing**—compared units before vs. after training pilot (2020 vs. 2022)
- **Controlled for confounds**—team size, tenure, function, business cycle effects

**Why Methods Are Credible:**
- **Actual organizational data, not estimates**—not surveys asking "do you think turnover is high?"; actual turnover counts from HRIS
- **Large sample**—thousands of employees, 180 managers, multiple business units (not small pilot)
- **Multiple data sources triangulate**—HRIS (objective), surveys (perceptions), financial systems (outcomes)—all converge
- **Research predictions match observed data**—science predicts 23-27% higher diverse turnover without inclusion; we see 27% vs. 16% (exact match validates we have standard "diversity without inclusion" problem)

**Key Finding from Methods:** High-inclusion units (≥80% managers trained) show 15.2% diverse turnover and $98,200 revenue/FTE vs. low-inclusion units (<70% trained) 23.8% turnover and $68,400 revenue/FTE—**internal proof-of-concept that solution works, just need to scale.**

## Detailed Organizational Evidence Methods

## Purpose of Organizational Evidence Collection

**Primary Goal:** Establish baseline levels of X→M→Y model using internal data

**X (Diversity):**
- Workforce and leadership composition (% diverse employees by level, function, location)
- Pipeline leakage (38% diverse at entry → 12% at VP+)

**M (Inclusion Mechanisms):**
- Training participation (who completed diversity/inclusion training, hours, dates)
- Inclusive leadership behaviors (360-degree feedback from diverse employees)
- Inclusion climate (engagement survey items on voice, fairness, respect, psychological safety)

**Y (Outcomes):**
- Turnover (voluntary, by demographics and unit)
- Engagement (survey scores by demographics and manager)
- Promotion rates (time-to-promotion by demographics)
- Performance (revenue per FTE by unit, team performance ratings)

**Secondary Goal:** Assess solution feasibility

**Organizational readiness:**
- Current training infrastructure (LMS, facilitators, budget)
- Manager capabilities and attitudes (360 feedback, survey responses on training needs)
- Stakeholder support (senior leadership commitment, manager willingness)

## Data Sources

**HRIS / People Analytics System (Primary Source):**
- **Employee demographics:** Race/ethnicity, gender, tenure, job level, function, location (from HR records)
- **Turnover data:** Voluntary vs. involuntary, exit dates, exit reasons (from termination records)—disaggregated by demographics, unit, manager
- **Promotion history:** Time-in-level, promotion dates, job level changes (from position history)
- **Compensation:** Pay band, salary, bonus (from payroll system)—for pay equity analysis

**Learning Management System (LMS):**
- **Training completion data:** Who completed diversity/inclusion training, inclusive leadership training, unconscious bias training
- **Training hours:** Time spent in training by employee and manager
- **Training adoption by unit:** % managers/employees completing training by business unit and level

**Engagement & Inclusion Surveys:**
- **Annual engagement survey** (enterprise-wide, n=3,200+ responses, 78% response rate)
- **Inclusion-related items:** "I feel my voice is heard," "I'm treated fairly," "I feel I belong," "I can be myself at work" (7-point Likert scales)
- **Psychological safety items:** "I can speak up without fear," "My manager values my input"
- **Disaggregated by demographics and manager/team**—compare diverse vs. majority employee experiences

**Performance & Financial Data:**
- **Team performance ratings:** Annual ratings by manager (1-5 scale)
- **Revenue per FTE by business unit:** From financial systems
- **Customer satisfaction / NPS:** Where available, by team/unit
- **Innovation proxies:** New products, process improvements, ideas submitted/implemented (tracked in some units)

**Talent Process Data:**
- **Performance rating distribution by demographics:** Do diverse employees get lower ratings?
- **Access to stretch assignments:** Tracked in some units—who gets high-visibility projects, promotions-track roles
- **Succession planning:** Leadership pipeline data (who's identified as high-potential, who gets sponsored)

**360-Degree Feedback on Inclusive Behaviors:**
- **180 managers rated** by direct reports on inclusive behaviors
- **Items:** "My manager interrupts me in meetings," "My manager values my ideas," "My manager treats all team members fairly"
- **Compared manager self-ratings vs. diverse employee ratings**—identified 1.1-point self-awareness gap (managers rate themselves 4.2, diverse employees rate them 3.1)

## Data Collection Approach

**Time Period:** 2022 full-year (most recent complete year with all data sources available)

**Retrospective data where available:**
- 2020-2022 trend data for turnover, engagement (to track before/after training pilot in some units)
- 2019-2022 promotion data (to identify pipeline leakage patterns over time)

**Disaggregation Strategy:**
- **All data disaggregated by demographics:** Race/ethnicity (5 categories: White, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, Asian, Other/Multiracial), gender (3 categories: Women, Men, Non-binary)
- **By manager:** Turnover, engagement, promotion rates tied to specific managers (identifies high vs. low inclusion managers)
- **By business unit:** Compare units with high training adoption (≥80% managers completed 40-hour program) vs. low adoption (<70%)

**Analysis Strategy:**

**1. X→M→Y Pathway Testing:**
- **X (Diversity) → Y (Outcomes) without M:** Do diverse teams with low inclusion mechanisms (M) show worse outcomes? (Yes: 27% turnover vs. 16%, 12-point engagement gap)
- **X (Diversity) + M (Inclusion) → Y:** Do diverse teams with high inclusion mechanisms show better outcomes? (Yes: High-inclusion units show 15.2% turnover, $98,200 revenue/FTE)

**2. High-Inclusion vs. Low-Inclusion Unit Comparison:**
- **High-inclusion units:** ≥80% managers completed 40-hour inclusive leadership program (n=4 units, 850 employees)
- **Low-inclusion units:** <70% managers completed training (n=6 units, 1,200 employees)
- **Compared outcomes:** Diverse employee turnover (15.2% vs. 23.8%), engagement (72 vs. 60 points), revenue per FTE ($98,200 vs. $68,400)

**3. Controlled Analysis:**
- **Control variables:** Team size, average tenure, function (engineering vs. sales vs. operations), business cycle effects (2022 was recession-concern year)
- **Why controls matter:** Without controls, high-inclusion units might just have easier jobs, more tenured employees, better markets—controls isolate inclusion mechanism effect

**4. Temporal Sequencing (Where Available):**
- **Before (2020) vs. After (2022) training pilot in 4 units**—did turnover/engagement improve post-training?
- **Result:** Units that piloted 40-hour program in 2021 showed 8-point engagement increase (2020: 64 → 2022: 72) and 5-point turnover reduction (2020: 20% → 2022: 15%)

## Why Organizational Methods Are Credible

**Strengths:**

**1. Actual Data, Not Estimates:**
- **Not surveys asking perceptions** ("do you think turnover is high?")—actual turnover counts from HRIS termination records
- **Not self-reported outcomes**—financial data from ERP, performance ratings from official reviews

**2. Large Sample:**
- **Thousands of employees** across multiple business units (not small pilot)
- **180 managers with 360 feedback** (representative sample)
- **3,200+ engagement survey responses** (78% response rate—high for employee surveys)

**3. Multiple Data Sources Triangulate:**
- **HRIS (objective):** Turnover, promotions, compensation
- **Surveys (perceptions):** Inclusion climate, engagement, psychological safety
- **Financial systems (outcomes):** Revenue per FTE, turnover costs
- **All converge on same pattern:** Diversity without inclusion → worse outcomes; diversity + inclusion → better outcomes

**4. Research Predictions Match Observed Data:**
- **Scientific evidence predicts:** Diversity without inclusion → 23-27% higher diverse turnover
- **Our organizational data shows:** 27% diverse turnover vs. 16% majority turnover (exact match)
- **Validates we have standard "diversity without inclusion" problem** described in research literature

**5. Internal Proof-of-Concept:**
- **High-inclusion units (≥80% managers trained):** 15.2% diverse turnover, $98,200 revenue/FTE
- **Low-inclusion units (<70% trained):** 23.8% diverse turnover, $68,400 revenue/FTE
- **36% lower turnover, 44% higher revenue** in high-inclusion units—internal proof solution works, just need to scale

Quantitative Data Collection

X (Diversity) Metrics
- Workforce diversity % by demographic group (overall and by level/function/location)
- Leadership diversity (manager and above)
- Team-level diversity indices (e.g., Blau index)

M (Mechanisms) Metrics
- Manager completion rate of inclusive leadership and D&I training
- 360 scores on inclusive leadership behaviors
- Total and type of diversity/inclusion training hours per manager

Y (Outcome) Metrics
- Team/segment innovation (ideas submitted/implemented, innovation output per team)
- Engagement scores by team and demographics
- Turnover by demographics and team, including early-tenure turnover
- Productivity (output per employee or per FTE)

Control Variables
To avoid misleading conclusions, analyses should control for:
- Team size, location, function, business unit, tenure (employee and manager), education where available, sector/line of business, and major external shocks (e.g., economic cycles).

Time Period
- Target 3–5 years of data where possible, with a minimum of 2 years for trend analysis.
- Use quarterly cuts when appropriate to see inflection points and seasonal patterns (e.g., hiring in Q1/Q3, turnover around bonus cycles, performance review timing).
- Establish a pre-intervention baseline (e.g., the most recent 12 months before any major inclusion training rollout) to support future pre/post comparisons.

Qualitative Data Collection

Internal Documents Review
- Policies & Processes: D&I, EEO, promotion, performance management, compensation, training requirements, and code of conduct.
- Leadership & Governance: Executive and board meeting minutes referencing diversity/inclusion, town hall transcripts, ERG reports.

Observational and Process Data
- Decision Processes: Observe promotion, hiring, and calibration discussions (who speaks, whose input carries weight, how criteria are applied).
- Workflows: How people actually get stretch roles, visibility, and sponsorship compared to formal processes.

Data Access Strategy
Required Permissions
- Key Data Owners:
    - HR/CHRO (HRIS, surveys, performance, training)
    - Compensation and Finance 
    - Diversity/Compliance 
- Approvals & Process:
    - Submit clear data requests stating: what is needed, why (X→M→Y analysis), how privacy is protected, and how data will be stored and used.
    - Involve Legal/Privacy for demographic and sensitive data, and secure an executive sponsor (ideally the CHRO and/or CEO) to support access.
- Privacy & Confidentiality:
    - Use de-identified, aggregated data; enforce minimum group sizes (e.g., 5–10 employees) for reporting.
    - De-identify qualitative data (comments, interviews).

Contact Plan
- CHRO / HR Director – anchor sponsor for HRIS, survey, performance, succession, and training data.
- CFO / Finance Director – for team-level or unit-level financials and cost-of-turnover estimates.
- Chief Diversity Officer / D&I Lead – for historical program context, ERG information, and prior analysis.

Ethical Considerations
- Protect employee privacy and confidentiality at all stages.
- Follow organizational and legal data use policies strictly.
- Limit data to what is actually needed to answer the X→M→Y questions.

Establishing Baselines
X (Diversity):
      - Track diversity by level, function, and location over several years.
      - Identify when the organization reached current diversity levels and where representation drops (e.g., entry vs. leadership).

M (Mechanisms):
      - Baseline training coverage and depth (e.g., awareness-only vs. skills-based, one-and-done vs. ongoing).
      - Baseline manager inclusive behavior scores (where 360s exist).
      - Baseline frequency of equity-focused reviews (pay, promotion, assignments).

- Y (Outcomes):
    - Normal operating ranges for engagement, turnover, promotion, innovation, productivity, and revenue per employee.
    - Define what "good" looks like internally and compare current values by demographic group.

Benchmarking
- Compare organizational diversity to:
    - Labor market availability (Census/industry data), and
    - Industry peer diversity (from public reports, where available).

Analyzing the Problem

Indicators of a Diversity–Performance Gap (X→Y)
Look for patterns such as:
- Rising or strong workforce diversity, but:
    - Persistent or widening engagement gaps for underrepresented groups,
    - Much lower representation at leadership levels,

Indicators of Missing or Weak Mechanisms (M)
- Low or uneven participation in inclusive leadership training.
- Training that is mainly one-off awareness sessions with no behavior focus or follow-through.

Quantifying Severity
- Engagement gaps (points difference between majority and underrepresented groups).
- Turnover ratios (diverse vs. majority turnover).

Testing the X→M→Y Pathway
Compare outcomes for:
- Teams with high diversity + high inclusion training/behavior scores
- Teams with high diversity + low inclusion metrics

Solution Feasibility Analysis
Resources and Infrastructure
- Budget: Current L&D and D&I spend; potential to reallocate or add investment for a pilot.
- Systems: LMS, HRIS, performance systems, and analytics capabilities needed to track X, M, and Y.
- People: L&D capacity to design/deliver training; HRBPs and D&I team capacity to support behavior change and accountability; analytics support.

Capability and Culture
- Managers: Baseline leadership effectiveness and openness to D&I; span of control and workload; historical responsiveness to prior initiatives.
- HR and D&I: Ability to interpret and act on data; credibility with the business; experience implementing change.
