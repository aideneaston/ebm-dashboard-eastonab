Internal Evidence Goals

Primary Goal
Collect internal data to establish baseline levels of:
- X (Diversity): Workforce and leadership composition
- M (Mechanisms): Training participation and inclusive leadership behaviors
- Y (Outcomes): Engagement, performance, innovation, and financial results

Secondary Goal
Assess solution feasibility by gathering data on:
- Organizational readiness and culture
- Manager capabilities, attitudes, and capacity
- Existing infrastructure and resources for training and accountability

Available Data Sources
Performance Metrics / KPIs
- Financial Data (Y): Revenue per employee, department/team profitability, training/diversity program spend, turnover and recruitment costs.
- Operational Data: Team productivity (output per FTE), project completion and quality, innovation indicators (ideas submitted/implemented), collaboration and cross-functional effectiveness.
- HR Data (X, M, Y):
    - Demographics by level, function, and location (X)
    - Turnover, engagement, promotion, and performance by demographics (Y)
    - Training completion and hours, especially for diversity/inclusion and leadership (M)
    - 360 feedback on inclusive behaviors (M)

Internal Systems
- CRM: Customer demographics, satisfaction scores, retention, and sales performance by account or segment.
- ERP / Operations: Production, output, and project data at team or unit level; resource allocation; potentially useful for linking team composition to outcomes.
- HRIS: Core people data (demographics, job levels, dates, compensation, promotions, training history, manager relationships, survey responses).
- Financial Systems: Revenue, cost, and margin by unit; payroll and comp data; training program costs.

Reports and Documentation
- Regular Reports: EEO-1, diversity dashboards, engagement survey summaries, turnover reports, performance review summaries, training completion reports, business unit performance reviews.
- Survey Results: Engagement and inclusion surveys, 360 manager feedback, pulse surveys, exit interviews.
- Audits & Assessments: Pay equity audits, hiring/promotion process reviews, HR compliance audits, training evaluations, culture and organizational assessments.
- Historical Studies: Earlier diversity initiatives, retention or turnover studies, benchmarking reports, prior internal analytics projects on team performance and composition.

Quantitative Data Collection

X (Diversity) Metrics
- Workforce diversity % by demographic group (overall and by level/function/location)
- Leadership diversity (manager and above)
- Team-level diversity indices (e.g., Blau index)

M (Mechanisms) Metrics
- Manager completion rate of inclusive leadership and D&I training
- 360 scores on inclusive leadership behaviors
- Total and type of diversity/inclusion training hours per manager

Y (Outcome) Metrics
- Team/segment innovation (ideas submitted/implemented, innovation output per team)
- Engagement scores by team and demographics
- Turnover by demographics and team, including early-tenure turnover
- Productivity (output per employee or per FTE)

Control Variables
To avoid misleading conclusions, analyses should control for:
- Team size, location, function, business unit, tenure (employee and manager), education where available, sector/line of business, and major external shocks (e.g., economic cycles).

Time Period
- Target 3–5 years of data where possible, with a minimum of 2 years for trend analysis.
- Use quarterly cuts when appropriate to see inflection points and seasonal patterns (e.g., hiring in Q1/Q3, turnover around bonus cycles, performance review timing).
- Establish a pre-intervention baseline (e.g., the most recent 12 months before any major inclusion training rollout) to support future pre/post comparisons.

Qualitative Data Collection

Internal Documents Review
- Policies & Processes: D&I, EEO, promotion, performance management, compensation, training requirements, and code of conduct.
- Leadership & Governance: Executive and board meeting minutes referencing diversity/inclusion, town hall transcripts, ERG reports.

Observational and Process Data
- Decision Processes: Observe promotion, hiring, and calibration discussions (who speaks, whose input carries weight, how criteria are applied).
- Workflows: How people actually get stretch roles, visibility, and sponsorship compared to formal processes.

Data Access Strategy
Required Permissions
- Key Data Owners:
    - HR/CHRO (HRIS, surveys, performance, training)
    - Compensation and Finance 
    - Diversity/Compliance 
- Approvals & Process:
    - Submit clear data requests stating: what is needed, why (X→M→Y analysis), how privacy is protected, and how data will be stored and used.
    - Involve Legal/Privacy for demographic and sensitive data, and secure an executive sponsor (ideally the CHRO and/or CEO) to support access.
- Privacy & Confidentiality:
    - Use de-identified, aggregated data; enforce minimum group sizes (e.g., 5–10 employees) for reporting.
    - De-identify qualitative data (comments, interviews).

Contact Plan
- CHRO / HR Director – anchor sponsor for HRIS, survey, performance, succession, and training data.
- CFO / Finance Director – for team-level or unit-level financials and cost-of-turnover estimates.
- Chief Diversity Officer / D&I Lead – for historical program context, ERG information, and prior analysis.

Ethical Considerations
- Protect employee privacy and confidentiality at all stages.
- Follow organizational and legal data use policies strictly.
- Limit data to what is actually needed to answer the X→M→Y questions.

Establishing Baselines
X (Diversity):
      - Track diversity by level, function, and location over several years.
      - Identify when the organization reached current diversity levels and where representation drops (e.g., entry vs. leadership).

M (Mechanisms):
      - Baseline training coverage and depth (e.g., awareness-only vs. skills-based, one-and-done vs. ongoing).
      - Baseline manager inclusive behavior scores (where 360s exist).
      - Baseline frequency of equity-focused reviews (pay, promotion, assignments).

- Y (Outcomes):
    - Normal operating ranges for engagement, turnover, promotion, innovation, productivity, and revenue per employee.
    - Define what "good" looks like internally and compare current values by demographic group.

Benchmarking
- Compare organizational diversity to:
    - Labor market availability (Census/industry data), and
    - Industry peer diversity (from public reports, where available).

Analyzing the Problem

Indicators of a Diversity–Performance Gap (X→Y)
Look for patterns such as:
- Rising or strong workforce diversity, but:
    - Persistent or widening engagement gaps for underrepresented groups,
    - Much lower representation at leadership levels,

Indicators of Missing or Weak Mechanisms (M)
- Low or uneven participation in inclusive leadership training.
- Training that is mainly one-off awareness sessions with no behavior focus or follow-through.

Quantifying Severity
- Engagement gaps (points difference between majority and underrepresented groups).
- Turnover ratios (diverse vs. majority turnover).

Testing the X→M→Y Pathway
Compare outcomes for:
- Teams with high diversity + high inclusion training/behavior scores
- Teams with high diversity + low inclusion metrics

Solution Feasibility Analysis
Resources and Infrastructure
- Budget: Current L&D and D&I spend; potential to reallocate or add investment for a pilot.
- Systems: LMS, HRIS, performance systems, and analytics capabilities needed to track X, M, and Y.
- People: L&D capacity to design/deliver training; HRBPs and D&I team capacity to support behavior change and accountability; analytics support.

Capability and Culture
- Managers: Baseline leadership effectiveness and openness to D&I; span of control and workload; historical responsiveness to prior initiatives.
- HR and D&I: Ability to interpret and act on data; credibility with the business; experience implementing change.
