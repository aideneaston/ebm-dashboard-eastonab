1. Organizational Evidence Overview

Overall Organizational Evidence Rating: HIGH-MODERATE
Confidence Level: ~8/10

You have rich internal data that directly map onto your X→M→Y model:
- X (Diversity): Representation and distribution of demographic groups across levels and units
- M (Training & Inclusion Mechanisms): Diversity / inclusive leadership training completion, inclusion climate, manager behavior indicators
- Y (Performance): Turnover, engagement, promotion rates, revenue per FTE, team performance scores

Strengths:
- Multiple years of HRIS data
- Enterprise-wide engagement surveys
- Training completion data from LMS
- Performance and financial metrics at unit level

Limitations:
- Some self-report bias (survey data)
- Incomplete inclusion climate measurement in a few units
- Causality cannot be definitively proven from internal correlations alone
- Some data only available for last 2–3 years

Even with those caveats, your internal evidence strongly confirms the scientific and practitioner patterns: high diversity + weak inclusion mechanisms → worse outcomes than homogeneous teams; diversity + strong inclusion mechanisms → substantially better outcomes.

2. Data Sources and Measures

HRIS / People Analytics System
- Employee demographics (race/ethnicity, gender, tenure, job level, function)
- Turnover (voluntary, involuntary) by demographic group and business unit
- Promotion history and time-in-level
- Compensation and pay band data

Learning Management System (LMS)
- Completion data for Diversity & Inclusion / Inclusive Leadership training
- Training hours by employee and by manager
- Training adoption by business unit and level

Engagement & Inclusion Surveys
- Annual engagement survey (enterprise-wide)
- Inclusion-related items (voice, fairness, respect, psychological safety, belonging)
- Breakdowns by demographic and by manager/team

Performance & Financial Data
- Team performance ratings
- Revenue per FTE by business unit
- Customer satisfaction / NPS by segment (where available)
- Innovation proxies (e.g., new products, process improvements, ideas implemented)

Talent Process Data
- Performance rating distribution by demographic
- Access to high-visibility projects / stretch assignments (tracked in some units)
- Succession planning and leadership pipeline data

3. Mapping Evidence to X → M → Y

Overall diversity:
- 38% of your workforce identifies as underrepresented (by race/ethnicity and/or gender in leadership roles).
- Frontline and early-career roles are often more diverse than mid- and senior-level roles.

Representation by level:
- Entry / Individual Contributor: ~45–48% underrepresented.
- Middle Management: drops to ~30–32% underrepresented.
- Senior Leadership (Director+): down to roughly 18–20% underrepresented.

Representation by function/business unit:
- Tech / Product / Innovation units are relatively more diverse at IC level but less so in leadership.
- Support functions (HR, community relations, some operations areas) show higher representation of underrepresented groups but limited pathways into P&L/strategic roles.

4. Quality Appraisal of Organizational Evidence

Strengths
- Large N: Thousands of employees over multiple years, across many teams and business units.
- Multiple data sources: HRIS (objective), LMS (objective), surveys (subjective but standardized), performance and financial data (objective).
- Temporal sequencing: Training pilots happened at identifiable times, so you can examine before vs. after trends in pilot vs. comparison units.
- Consistent patterns: X→M→Y pattern appears repeatedly across different units and metrics.

Limitations
- Non-random assignment: Managers weren't randomly assigned to receive training or not; many pilot managers may have been more progressive or high-performing already → risk of selection bias.
- Unmeasured confounders: Other initiatives (e.g., new leadership, process changes, comp adjustments) may also influence turnover and performance.
- Measurement gaps: Inclusion climate not measured in every unit annually; newer metrics may only have 1–2 years of history.
- Self-report bias: Engagement/inclusion measures are survey-based and can be affected by current events, survey fatigue, or skepticism.

5. Alignment with Scientific and Practitioner Evidence
High diversity, low inclusion units:
- Higher turnover of underrepresented employees (≧27–35%)
- Larger engagement gaps (10–15 points)
- More conflict / lower psychological safety
- Lower revenue per FTE than homogeneous teams

This matches:
- Scientific evidence on the diversity-performance paradox
- Practitioner evidence from Fuller, Washington, Creary on "diversity without inclusion"
- Case studies (Intel, J&J, Salesforce) pre-intervention state
