## **Core Evaluation Questions**

- Is ILDP reducing diverse employee turnover by the predicted 35–42%?
    - Baseline: 27% → Target: 16–18%

- Are engagement and promotion inequities closing?
    - Engagement gap (12 pts) → ≤4 pts; promotion gap (35% slower) → ≤10% slower

- Are inclusive leadership behaviors improving at scale?
    - 360 ratings: 3.1 baseline → 3.8+ target

- Are accountability mechanisms implemented with fidelity?
    - 100% bias interrupter usage + full demographic tracking

- Is the initiative delivering expected ROI (2.5:1–6.5:1)?

- Do stakeholders maintain confidence, and is inclusion authentically improving?

## **Success Metrics Dashboard (Executive Summary)**

### **Primary Outcome KPIs:**

- Diverse turnover: Baseline 27% → Target 16–18% (18–24 months)
- Engagement gap: Baseline 12 pts → Target ≤4 pts (18–24 months)
- Promotion equity: Baseline 35% slower → Target ≤10% slower (18–24 months)
- 360 leadership behaviors: Baseline 3.1 → Target 3.8+ (12–18 months)
- ROI: Target ≥2.5:1 (18–24 months)

### **Process KPIs:**

- 85%+ training completion
- 90%+ quarterly reinforcement attendance
- 100% bias interrupter usage in hiring/promotion
- Stakeholder support ≥80%
- Zero retaliation incidents

## **Evaluation Design**

Approach:

- Mixed-method, before-after, and multi-cohort evaluation using:
    - HRIS trend analysis (monthly)
    - Annual engagement surveys + 6-month pulse surveys
    - 360-degree feedback at baseline, 6, and 12 months
    - Bias interrupter adoption logs
    - Listening sessions with diverse employees (Months 6, 13, 18)
    - Manager interviews (Month 12)
    - Financial ROI modeling (Months 12, 18, 24)

### **Why it works:**

- This design directly tests whether the training → behavior change → talent outcomes pathway operates as predicted by scientific evidence

## **Timeline for Executive Decision Points**

### **Month 6 – Early Pilot Readout:**

- Executives see:
    - Behavior change emerging (360s + observations)
    - Bias interrupter compliance
    - Early turnover and engagement trends
    - Stakeholder confidence score
- Decision: Proceed to full rollout? Adjust curriculum? Strengthen accountability?

### **Month 12 – Critical Go/No-Go Evaluation:**

- Executives receive:
    - Turnover trajectory (≥10% reduction required to stay on track)
    - 360 improvement (≥25–30%)
    - Engagement/promotion movement
    - ROI early estimate (≥1.5:1)
    - Support levels (≥80%)
- Decision: Continue / Modify / Pause

### **Month 18 – Performance Impact Window:**

- Executives receive:
    - Turnover reduction approaching target
    - Promotion equity trending toward parity
    - Inclusion climate improvements
    - ROI estimate trending ≥2.5:1
- Decision: Institutionalize ILDP? Scale to new managers? Adjust reinforcement cadence?

### **Month 24 – Final Summative Evaluation:**

- Comprehensive outcome review
- ROI confirmation
- Long-term sustainability plan
- Recommendations for Years 3–5
- Decision: Embed ILDP into core leadership model

## **Executive-Facing Success Thresholds**

### **Must-Achieve (Program success depends on these):**

- 35–42% turnover reduction (primary ROI driver)
- ROI ≥2.5:1 by Month 24
- No retaliation incidents
- Stakeholder confidence ≥80%

### **Should-Achieve:**

- Engagement gap closes by ≥60%
- Promotion equity gap cut in half
- 360 behaviors rise to ≥3.7

### **Could-Achieve (strategic upside):**

- Revenue-per-FTE gap narrows significantly
- Psychological safety reaches high-performing team norms
- Inclusion becomes normalized cultural behavior

## **Risks Monitored at the Executive Level**

- Premature abandonment:
    - Executive Signal: Leaders question ROI before Month 12
    - Mitigation: Reinforce evidence timeline + show leading indicators

- Training without accountability:
    - Executive Signal: Bias interrupter usage <80%
    - Mitigation: Link usage to performance reviews

- Backlash:
    - Executive Signal: Majority employee engagement declines
    - Mitigation: Reframe ILDP as performance initiative

- Retaliation:
    - Executive Signal: Exit interviews mention subtle retaliation
    - Mitigation: Immediate HR investigation + CEO messaging
