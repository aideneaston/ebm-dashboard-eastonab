### Timing Plan
- **Outreach Start Date:** Week 1 of practitioner evidence milestone period (immediately after completing scientific evidence phase)
- **Interview Window:** 3-week window to conduct 6-8 interviews (allows flexibility for scheduling)
- **Follow-up Period:** 2-week buffer after interviews for clarification questions and review of quotes/attributions

## Ethical Considerations

### Informed Consent
- **Purpose Explanation:** At start of interview, clearly explain this is academic research for MGT357 Evidence-Based Management course examining how diversity training impacts organizational performance. Emphasize goal is to identify evidence-based best practices, not to critique specific companies or individuals.
- **Use of Information:** Insights will be aggregated with other practitioner perspectives and combined with scientific and organizational data to develop evidence-based recommendations. May be included in academic dashboard project and potentially course presentations.
- **Anonymity/Attribution:** Offer choice: (1) Full attribution with name/title/company, (2) Partial attribution with title/industry only, (3) Complete anonymity. Default to anonymity unless explicit permission given for attribution. More candid responses often come with anonymity guarantee.
- **Approval Process:** If using direct quotes or specific company examples, send relevant sections to practitioner for review and approval before finalizing. Allow them to edit, clarify, or retract statements. This builds trust and ensures accuracy.

### Professional Courtesy
- **Time Respect:** Stick to agreed 30-45 minute timeframe. Set timer reminder at 25 minutes to wrap up. If conversation is valuable and they have time, ask permission to extend. Send pre-interview questions 24 hours in advance so they can prepare.
- **Preparation:** Research their background, company, and any published work beforehand. Prepare specific, informed questions tailored to their experience. Have backup questions ready. Test technology before call. Be ready 5 minutes early.
- **Follow-through:** Send thank you email within 24 hours. Share findings as promised (even if takes time to complete analysis). Acknowledge their contribution appropriately. Connect on LinkedIn if appropriate. Offer to reciprocate if they ever need student research assistance.

## Expected Challenges

### Access Challenges
**Challenge:** Senior practitioners (CDOs, VPs) are extremely busy and may not respond to student requests. DEI has become politically sensitive, making some organizations hesitant to discuss their programs publicly.

**Mitigation:** Cast wide net (contact 15-20 to get 6-8 responses). Leverage personal networks, alumni connections, and warm introductions rather than cold outreach. Target mid-level practitioners (managers, consultants) who may be more accessible but still have valuable insights. Emphasize academic/evidence-based nature of research rather than advocacy position.

### Response Rate Concerns
**Challenge:** Typical response rate for cold academic outreach is 10-20%, meaning I need to contact 30-40 practitioners to achieve target of 6-8 interviews.

**Mitigation:** Personalize every message (avoid template language). Demonstrate I've researched their work specifically. Keep initial request short and clear. Offer flexible scheduling. Time outreach strategically (avoid end of quarter, holidays). Use multiple channels (email + LinkedIn). Follow up professionally. Have backup list of secondary targets. Consider offering small incentive (Amazon gift card if budget allows, though may not be necessary for professional courtesy).

### Quality Concerns
**Challenge:** Risk of getting superficial, socially-desirable responses ("diversity is great, everyone should do it") rather than honest assessments of what works and doesn't work. Some practitioners may lack real data on outcomes.

**Mitigation:** Ask for specific examples and concrete metrics rather than general opinions. Use probing follow-up questions. Frame questions to invite criticism ("what hasn't worked"). Ask about failures as learning opportunities. Prioritize practitioners who publish data/metrics in their work. Cross-validate responses across multiple practitioners and against scientific literature. Apply Peterson Framework to assess quality of practitioner expertise (critical incidents, feedback quality, environmental consistency).

### Time Constraints
**Challenge:** 3-week window for interviews is tight, especially if response time is slow or practitioners need to reschedule. Transcription and analysis add additional time burden.

**Mitigation:** Start outreach immediately at beginning of milestone period. Schedule interviews as soon as responses come in rather than waiting. Build in buffer time. Be prepared to conduct more interviews in shorter timeframe if early responses are strong. Have questions and documentation templates ready to go. Consider partial transcription (key quotes only) rather than full transcription to save time. If absolutely necessary, can supplement with fewer interviews but deeper case study research.

## Backup Plans

### Alternative Sources
**If primary interview targets don't respond:**
- Leverage published practitioner accounts: HBR case studies, SHRM articles authored by practitioners, McKinsey/Deloitte consultant reports, TEDx talks by CDOs, podcast interviews with diversity leaders
- Contact authors of published case studies - often more responsive since they've already gone public with their work
- Attend virtual DEI webinars and ask questions during Q&A, follow up with presenters afterward
- Survey approach: Create shorter, structured survey (15 questions) and distribute via SHRM forums, LinkedIn groups for quicker responses from more practitioners (breadth over depth)
- Use detailed company case studies from annual DEI reports as "virtual interviews" - many Fortune 500 companies publish extensive data
- Interview HR/management professors with consulting experience as proxy for multiple practitioner perspectives

### Modified Approaches
**If response rate is lower than expected:**
- Reduce target to 4-5 high-quality interviews rather than 6-8 (focus on quality over quantity)
- Supplement with panel discussions/group webinars instead of individual interviews (one session, multiple practitioners)
- Extend interview window by 1 week if project timeline allows
- Shift balance toward published case studies and practitioner-authored articles if direct access is limited
- Use email-based interviews (send questions, get written responses) for practitioners who can't schedule call
- Leverage second-degree connections more aggressively (ask professors, classmates, family for introductions)

### Minimum Viable Evidence
**Core requirement for credible practitioner evidence:**
- **Minimum:** 4 practitioner perspectives from different contexts (1 consultant, 1 tech/healthcare HR leader, 1 traditional industry HR, 1 academic-practitioner) PLUS 3-4 detailed published case studies with quantitative outcomes
- **Must include:** At least one success story with metrics (X→M→Y validation) and one failure story with lessons learned
- **Must demonstrate:** Understanding of System 1/System 2 biases, environmental factors affecting implementation, specific training program elements that work/don't work
- **Must validate:** Our X (diversity) → M (training) → Y (performance) logic model with real-world examples showing causal pathway
- **Peterson Framework requirements:** Assess credibility of each practitioner on 3 dimensions, identify at least 3 cognitive biases affecting practitioner judgment, document evidence quality

**Acceptable compromises if needed:** Can shift more weight to scientific evidence and organizational data if practitioner access is truly limited, but must be explicit about this limitation and its impact on conclusions.

---
INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Start outreach early - practitioners are busy and may take time to respond
2. Be professional and clear about your academic purpose
3. Prepare thoroughly for interviews to make the most of practitioners' time
4. Have backup sources in case your primary targets aren't available
5. Consider offering something valuable in return for their time
