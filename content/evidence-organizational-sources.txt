## KEY FINDINGS FOR HR MANAGERS

**Bottom Line:** Our internal data perfectly matches research predictions. Diverse employee turnover (27% vs. 16%) is 69% higher—exactly what science predicts without inclusion mechanisms. But units with 80%+ inclusion training already show 36% lower turnover (15.2% vs. 23.8%)—proof the solution works internally.

**The Crisis in Numbers:**
- **$26.2M annual cost:** $8.4M excess turnover + $3.6M disengagement + $14.2M unrealized performance
- **27% vs. 16% turnover:** Diverse employees leave at 69% higher rate
- **12-point engagement gap:** 56% diverse vs. 68% majority
- **33% longer time-to-promotion:** 3.2 years vs. 2.4 years for diverse employees
- **Pipeline leakage:** 38% diverse at entry → 12% at VP+

**Proof the Solution Works (Internal Evidence):**
- **High-inclusion units (80%+ training):** 15.2% diverse turnover, $98,200 revenue/FTE
- **Low-inclusion units (<70% training):** 23.8% diverse turnover, $68,400 revenue/FTE
- **Performance gap:** 36% lower turnover, 44% higher revenue/FTE in high-inclusion units

**Why Current Training Failed:**
- 89% of managers took 2-hour unconscious bias training
- Zero measurable impact on behavior or outcomes
- Meanwhile, 40-hour leadership program (unrelated to inclusion) DID produce measurable behavior change

**What This Means:** We already have internal proof-of-concept. High-inclusion units show the solution works. We just need to scale what's working to all 180 managers.

## Organizational Data Analysis

**Data Sources (Full-year 2022):**
- HRIS (demographics, headcount, promotions, turnover)
- LMS (training records)
- Financial systems (revenue, payroll)
- HR analytics (disaggregated turnover/promotion rates)
- Industry benchmarks (Census ABS, BLS)

Key X–M–Y Metrics
X: Workforce Diversity
- Overall ownership/lead composition across units: 66.8% male-owned, 33.2% female-owned; 66.2% White, 16.9% Hispanic, 13.0% Asian, 8.7% Black.
- Representation has improved slightly (e.g., female +1.2 pp over 12 months), but leadership is still ~15 pp less diverse than the broader workforce.
- Compared to Census ABS, the organization underrepresents women in ownership/leadership by about 6–7 pp and is only modestly above minority ownership benchmarks.

M: Inclusive Leadership Training & Mechanisms
- 68.4% of business units have some form of D&I training, but only ~34% of managers have completed behavior-focused inclusive leadership training.
- Most programs (about 72%) are awareness-only, not real skills training. Only 28% of units tie diversity metrics to manager performance reviews.
- Internal comparisons show a clear pattern:
    - Units with 80%+ inclusive leadership training: 15.2% turnover for diverse employees
    - Units with <70% training: 23.8% turnover

Y: Performance Outcomes (Turnover & Revenue)
- Average turnover: 16.8% overall. Diverse employees are at 27% vs. 16% for majority employees – a 69% higher rate.
- Revenue per employee: average $83,246, but with a huge spread:
    - Top quartile units: $120,584 per employee, ~10% turnover
    - Bottom quartile units: $61,027 per employee, ~26% turnover
- The diversity + training interaction is very clear:
    - Diverse + low training units: 23.8% turnover, $68,400 per employee
    - Diverse + high training units (80%+): 15.2% turnover, $98,200 per employee
    - Homogeneous units (any training level): ~17.5% turnover, $79,100 per employee

Internal Reports: What They Tell Us
Engagement & Inclusion (Survey Data)
- Overall engagement is 68% favorable, which is typical for the industry, but only 56% for underrepresented employees.
- Inclusion-type items show the sharpest gaps:
    - "My ideas are valued": 52% (diverse) vs. 71% (majority)
    - "I can be authentic at work": 48% vs. 73%
- Exit interviews back this up: diverse leavers cite "lack of belonging" (74%) and "unfair evaluation" (68%) as top reasons.
- Takeaway: The problem is not just representation; it is day-to-day inclusion and perceived fairness, especially tied to manager behavior.

Diversity & Talent Analytics
- Hiring is relatively strong (about 42% of new hires are from underrepresented groups), but 27% leave within 18 months.
- Promotion and progression show a 33% longer time-to-promotion for diverse employees (3.2 vs. 2.4 years).
- Representation drops dramatically as levels rise: 38% diverse at entry down to 12% at VP+.
- Takeaway: We have a "revolving door" and leaky pipeline: we bring diversity in, then lose it or stall it.

Training Program Evaluation
- The current unconscious bias training, rolled out to 89% of managers, showed no measurable impact on behavior or outcomes.
- In contrast, a separate 40-hour leadership development program (not focused on inclusion) produced measurable behavior change and better team outcomes.
- Takeaway: Quick, check-the-box bias training doesn't work. Longer, skill-based, practice-heavy training with accountability does. That is the model we'd need to follow for inclusive leadership.

Process Example: Performance Management

The performance management and talent review process is one of the main places where the diversity–inclusion gap becomes structural:
- Ratings show clear disparities: diverse employees are far more likely to sit in "meets expectations" even when objective productivity is similar.
- Subjective criteria like "culture fit" and "executive presence" show up heavily in calibration discussions and tend to work against underrepresented employees.
- Historical data is very telling: pre-2018 (when the workforce was less diverse), performance ratings and promotion rates were relatively equitable. As diversity grew rapidly, processes were not updated, and bias started to show up in ratings and promotions.
- Bottom line: This core process is currently amplifying the problem rather than correcting it, and it is exactly where inclusive leadership skills plus structured "bias interrupters" would make the most difference.

Financial Summary

Using conservative assumptions:
- Excess turnover cost attributable to the inclusion problem is roughly $8.4M per year.
- Productivity and time-to-productivity impacts add several more million (e.g., ~$3.6M from disengagement and ~$1.8M from slower ramp-up).
- Opportunity cost from underperforming diverse teams (compared to our own high-inclusion teams) is estimated around $14.2M in unrealized contribution.

Readiness & Success Factors

Overall organizational readiness looks moderate-to-high:

Strengths:
- Budget and systems exist (HRIS, LMS, 360s, analytics).
- Prior change efforts (e.g., leadership program, hybrid work) were mostly successful.
- Managers say they are willing to build inclusion skills, and employees generally believe diversity helps the business.

Challenges:
- Accountability is weak (very few leaders actually have diversity tied to compensation).
- There is change fatigue and skepticism due to past "check-the-box" D&I efforts that didn't deliver.

Given what we see in the internal data, five conditions seem non-negotiable for an inclusive leadership program to work:
- Behavior-focused, long-term training (not one-off awareness).
- Real accountability (manager metrics and compensation tied to inclusion outcomes).
- Systematic measurement and transparent dashboards at the team/manager level.
