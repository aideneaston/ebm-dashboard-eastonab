## **SMART Success Criteria**
*Note: Initial criteria updated based on evidence synthesis. Evidence predicts specific effect sizes and timelines that inform realistic targets.*

### **Criterion 1: Diverse Employee Turnover Reduction**
- **Specific:** Reduce diverse employee voluntary turnover rate tracked monthly via HRIS, disaggregated by race × gender × identity
- **Measurable:** 35-42% reduction from baseline 27% to target 16-18% (matching scientific effect size d ≈ 0.42 and practitioner benchmarks)
- **Achievable:** Yes—convergent evidence from 4 sources shows 40-60 hour behavioral training + accountability achieves this range; requires sustained implementation fidelity
- **Relevant:** Primary ROI driver ($9-11M annual savings) and ethical imperative; directly addresses "revolving door" problem
- **Time-bound:** Behavior change visible 6-12 months; turnover reduction achieved 18-24 months; monthly tracking with quarterly analysis; critical go/no-go evaluation at Month 12 (must show ≥10% reduction trajectory)

### **Criterion 2: Engagement Gap Closure**
- **Specific:** Close gap between diverse employee engagement (baseline 56%) and majority employee engagement (68%)—currently 12-point gap
- **Measurable:** Reduce gap to ≤4 points (from 12 to ≤4) using annual engagement survey + 6-month pulse surveys, with particular focus on inclusion items ("ideas valued," "can be authentic")
- **Achievable:** Yes—evidence shows inclusion climate improvements directly impact engagement; realistic based on practitioner case studies showing 50-70% gap closure
- **Relevant:** Engagement predicts performance, innovation, and retention; validates that inclusion improvements are authentic, not performative
- **Time-bound:** Expect 25-50% gap closure (12→6-9 points) by Month 12; full target (≤4 points) by Month 24; pulse surveys every 6 months

### **Criterion 3: Promotion Equity**
- **Specific:** Reduce time-to-promotion gap for diverse employees (currently 35% slower: 3.2 years vs. 2.4 years) and achieve rate parity
- **Measurable:** Reduce gap to 5-10% slower (demonstrating practical equity while acknowledging structural pipeline constraints)
- **Achievable:** Yes—bias interrupters in promotion processes + manager behavior change address root cause (subjective criteria like "executive presence" currently disadvantage diverse employees)
- **Relevant:** Pipeline sustainability—if diverse employees hired but don't advance, problem perpetuates; also tests whether bias interrupters work structurally
- **Time-bound:** Expect 15-20% improvement by Month 12, full target 5-10% gap by Month 24; tracked via HRIS quarterly

## **Measurement Framework**

### **Quantitative Metrics**
- **Primary:** Diverse employee turnover rate (monthly HRIS extracts, quarterly trend analysis, disaggregated by demographics)
- **Secondary:** Engagement gap (annual survey + 6-month pulses), promotion equity ratio (quarterly HRIS analysis), 360-degree inclusive behavior ratings (baseline, 6-month, 12-month waves)
- **Financial:** ROI calculation—(turnover cost savings + performance gains) ÷ program investment; target 2.5:1-6.5:1 by Month 24
- **Process:** Training completion rates (target 85%+), bias interrupter usage (target 100% by Month 4), reinforcement attendance (target 90%+)

### **Qualitative Indicators**
- **Listening sessions:** Diverse employees report authentic inclusion vs. performative diversity (62% currently experience weekly exclusion—target reduction to 20-30%)
- **Exit interview themes:** Shift from inclusion-related departures (74% cite "lack of belonging") to other factors (compensation, external opportunities)
- **Manager interviews:** Perceived utility of bias interrupters, behavioral confidence, peer cohort effectiveness
- **Cultural markers:** Inclusive behaviors become normalized beyond trained managers; new managers adopt practices without formal training (cultural diffusion)

### **Leading vs. Lagging Indicators**

#### **Leading Indicators (Early signals of progress—visible Months 3-12)**
- Training completion rates and satisfaction scores (target 85%+ and 4.0+)
- Bias interrupter adoption in talent decisions (usage logs show 100% by Month 4)
- 360-degree behavior ratings show 25-40% improvement by Month 6
- Stakeholder confidence maintains ≥80% (baseline 86%)
- Psychological safety pulse improvements (6-month intervals)

#### **Lagging Indicators (Final outcomes—visible Months 12-24)**
- Turnover rate reductions (critical evaluation at Month 12: ≥10% reduction required; full target 35-42% by Month 24)
- Engagement gap closure (expect 25-50% by Month 12, full closure ≤4 points by Month 24)
- Promotion equity shifts (rate parity movement visible Month 12-18)
- Team performance improvements (12-19% gains in diverse teams, measured via revenue per FTE or productivity metrics)
- ROI confirmation (≥1.5:1 by Month 12, ≥2.5:1 by Month 24)

## **Baseline Measurements**

### **Current State Metrics (Evidence-Based)**

**Primary Outcome Metrics:**
- Diverse employee turnover: 27% (vs. 16% majority = 69% higher rate)
- Engagement gap: 12 points (56% diverse vs. 68% majority)
- Promotion equity: 35% slower (3.2 years vs. 2.4 years)
- Annual cost: $26.2M (turnover + disengagement + lost performance)

**Behavioral Metrics:**
- Manager self-rated inclusion: 4.2 (360-degree ratings from diverse employees: 3.1—significant gap indicates low self-awareness)
- Current training: 2-hour awareness training, no measurable impact (d ≈ 0.08 per evidence)

**Performance Metrics:**
- Diverse teams in low-inclusion units: underperform by 8-15%, turnover 23.8%
- Diverse teams in high-inclusion units: 15.2% turnover, $98,200 revenue per FTE (vs. $68,400 low-inclusion)

### **Data Collection Plan**
- **HRIS:** Monthly turnover/promotion extracts (3-year historical baseline for trend analysis); disaggregated by race × gender × identity
- **Engagement surveys:** Annual comprehensive + 6-month pulses; baseline collected Month -2 to 0
- **360-degree feedback:** Baseline assessment for all 180 managers (Month -1 to 0); repeat at Months 6, 12
- **Stakeholder confidence:** Survey 217 stakeholders at baseline, Months 6, 12, 18, 24
- **Financial tracking:** Budget actuals vs. plan ($360-540k investment); turnover cost savings calculated quarterly

## **Success Thresholds**
*Evidence-based targets aligned with scientific effect sizes and practitioner benchmarks*

### **Must-Achieve (Program success depends on meeting these)**
- **35-42% turnover reduction** (27%→16-18% by Month 24); Month 12 checkpoint requires ≥10% reduction trajectory

### **Stretch Goals (Could-Achieve—Strategic upside)**
- **Revenue per FTE gap fully closes** ($29,800 gap→$10-15k or less)
- **Psychological safety reaches high-performing norms** (<10% weekly exclusion vs. current 62%)
- **Cultural transformation** beyond trained managers (inclusion behaviors diffuse organizationally, embedded in processes/norms)
- **Employer brand strength** in diverse talent markets (becomes recruiting advantage)

## **Stakeholder-Specific Success Criteria**

### **Executive Leadership Success Measures**
- **Financial:** $9-11M annual savings from turnover reduction; ROI 2.5:1-6.5:1
- **Strategic:** Competitive advantage through diverse team performance (12-19% gains); employer brand strength
- **Risk mitigation:** Reputation protection; reduced legal/compliance risk; talent pipeline sustainability

### **Manager Success Measures  **
- **Practical tools:** Bias interrupters reduce subjective decision-making burden; clear frameworks for inclusive behaviors
- **Team performance:** Diverse teams shift from underperforming (-8-15%) to outperforming (+12-19%)
- **Retention:** Reduce churn and associated costs/disruption (diverse employee turnover 27%→16-18%)

- **Cost management:** $26.2M annual cost reduced significantly through turnover prevention
- **Scalability:** Model can extend to new managers, other employee populations, sustainability mechanisms
- **Strategic partnership:** HR positioned as driver of competitive advantage, not compliance function

## **Risk Indicators**

### **Red Flags (Trigger immediate investigation)**
- **Turnover increases or stalls:** Month 12 turnover shows <10% reduction trajectory
- **Backlash evidence:** Majority employee engagement declines; resistance themes in manager feedback
- **Retaliation signals:** Exit interviews mention subtle retaliation; diverse employees report increased fear
- **Implementation fidelity failure:** Bias interrupter usage <80%; training completion <85%; reinforcement attendance <90%
- **Stakeholder support collapse:** Confidence drops below 75% (from 86% baseline)

### **Mitigation Triggers**
- **Month 6 evaluation:** If pilot shows weak behavior change (<20% on 360s), intensify practice/reinforcement before scaling
- **Month 12 go/no-go:** If must-achieve criteria off-track, pause rollout for root cause analysis (implementation failure? theory failure? context mismatch?)
- **Quarterly steering committee:** Reviews all risk indicators; approves immediate adjustments (curriculum refinements, reinforcement frequency, targeted support for resistant managers)
- **Real-time monitoring:** HR business partners surface concerns within 48 hours; anonymous feedback channels reviewed weekly
